HOW BIG IS BABY
The Bump is the original home of the cute fruit :)

Plus, find comprehensive updates about the changes and developments happening to both your baby and body, and learn how best to prepare for them.

INSIDE THE BUMP
An exciting and exclusive 3D interactive visualization of baby's growth week-by-week. Interact and learn new facts about baby and the changes inside your body. This uses BioDigital Inc.'s proprietary technology.

DAILY CONTENT
Everyday, the award-winning editorial staff of The Bump delivers fresh and relevant content for the specific week of your pregnancy. The articles are  timely and extensive: always know what’s safe and normal; find out how to ward off morning sickness; learn the best things to pack in your hospital bag; and discover how fellow moms are embracing pregnancy and motherhood.

REGISTRY
The Bump is the #1 Baby Registry destination in the US, hosting over 1 million registries every year! The Bump has become #1 by solving two of Baby Registry’s biggest challenges:

+ The Bump has collected over 15,000 of the top registry products across Babies “R” Us, Target, Amazon, buy buy Baby and Walmart, WITH REVIEWS for most of the products. This will quickly grow to over 100,000 products so you can find everything you want and need for your Registry.

+ The typical mom-to-be will register at two stores because there are always some special items that require a special, secondary registry. The Bump has you covered! The Bump will AUTOMATICALLY track all your registries across each retailer so you can keep tabs on what you’ve registered for, what’s been purchased and what still remains.

BELLY AND BABY PHOTOS
Document your pregnancy by creating a weekly album of your happily growing belly. And once baby is born, the album expands to track the first amazing year of baby’s life.

INNOVATIVE CALENDAR
We weren't satisfied with the methods other apps used to enter women's cycle dates. We went through hundreds of prototypes before we were satisfied with the result. 

PERIOD TRACKER
We wanted a display that was simple yet beautiful. A page that could be viewed with only a passing glance yet still have it's own personality. 

OVULATION PREDICTIONS
Viewing your ovulation predictions is fast and easy with our calculator. Gone are the days of information clutter.

MOOD TRACKER
With Life's innovative multiple entry method, you can create separate entries for each mood as often as you feel them.

IRREGULAR CYCLE SUPPORT
By default, the app defines cycles as irregular if the cycle has a length less than 21 days or over 36 days but these values are easily personalised to fit your needs within Settings. 

MENSTRUAL HISTORY
The menstrual history was visually optimised to include thoughtful choices that take advantage of the available real estate in an easy-to-read vertical orientation. 

CYCLE HISTORY 
The days of difficult-to-create reminders are over. Our cycle reminders are easy to create, modify, and set.

SYMPTOM TRACKER 
One of the best features: each symptom can be kept as a separate entry for later analysis or to share with your physician.

Our leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. 

'I found it in a nano second. It is very very quick to pick it up' Charlotte Hall, 36w

Category #1 in the UK and 25 other countries. Here's why...

Developed by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's heartbeat and other sounds - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.

'Found him or her very quickly very easy to find :)' - Katie, 26w

**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****
Yes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's sounds and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.

It may take time to find, and depends on the position of your baby so you'll need to stick with it and be patient. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 30-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. 

We constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.

We want you to be happy with HMB and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!

FAQs

**** No Accessories Required ****
We use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your baby heartbeat.

**** Works Beautifully From 27 Weeks ****
It is possible (but less likely) to hear from as early as 16-20 weeks, best results are most often achieved as the baby gets larger.

**** How It Works ****
1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. 
2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.
3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.
4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment
5. Take a selfie if you wish and share 
6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best results

**** Easy Share Feature ****
Sharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.

**** We Care About Your Privacy ****
We take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.

**** Before you start... ****
You DO need to follow the instructions for HMB to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive in the heartbeat range.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other sounds :) 

Please Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.

**** Supported Phones ****
8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.

**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***
HMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.

**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****
No - we wouldn't wish to claim otherwise. Under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong with your baby :)- Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA or any other medical authority. This is not a medical device. 

Please do check our T&Cs before downloading.

My Future Baby Test - Boy Or Girl? offers 3 different ways to learn your future baby's gender:
1. Chinese Method
2. Blood Type Method
3. Special Method

CHINESE METHOD
Very popular way not only to find out the baby's gender during pregnancy, but also to plan your baby's gender before conceiving! It's very easy, all you need to know is the birth months of the future mom and dad, and the month of conception. This method has proved to be trustworthy and Chinese scholars claim it's 98% effective!

BLOOD TYPE METHOD
Determine the baby's gender in a few seconds by using the blood types and Rh factors of future parents.

SPECIAL METHOD
The last but not the least! This test is less effective than the 2 previous ones, but it's funny: just press your finger on the screen or press your device to your belly, and find out your baby's gender!

-When should I measure my body temperatures？

Right after you get up in the morning before you drink or eat anything. Take 3 or 5 minutes to measure your oral temperature. The temperature is called the Basal Body Temperature(BBT).

-How should I know the indication of ovulation from the chart?

The rise in temperatures can be seen during ovulation, which is the best timing of pregnancy. Next time you predict the day of ovulation according to the BBTs.

-How is the Moon related to the menstruation?

The Moon phases are only used to help you remember the days of menstruation. Because the average length of the menstrual cycle is similar to that of the lunar cycle(28 days). The word ""menstruation"" is etymologically related to ""moon"". It is related to the Greek mene (moon).","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

5 STARS FROM OUR USERS

“Quit Genius has so far been the most effective approach to motivate me to stop smoking. It helps you to understand what triggers your addiction on a deep level. What I like best is the app is designed to be there for you even after you’ve quit. I’ve not smoked for over 3 months.” by joanikin.

“I've been trying to quit smoking for the best part of 2 years. I got it down from smoking at every given opportunity to about 5 a day by myself but Quit Genius helped me get over that final hurdle and give up altogether. I've now been smoke free for about 6 weeks and I've never felt better. Would recommend to anyone who needs that additional support but does not have the money / time to see a specialist in person - this app is just as helpful!” Bennyboilerman

The prenatal sonic stimulation may have some positive results for your baby like increased cognitive development, improved sleep patterns, enhance attention spans and improve language skills.

Classical music has a calming effect rendering the heart to beat slower as well as the breathing to be deeper. This is because the music compels the brain to release endorphin which naturally relaxes the body. Thus, stress is reduced and mood is improved which are great for a baby’s well-being as well as for the caring parent. 

This app is great for future moms as well for those that already have babies to help them fall asleep and relax. It reduces stress and anxiety and helps moms get rid of postnatal depression!

Others have no frame of reference to help them recognize the true potential for their lives. It is easy to get so caught up in the midst of difficult circumstances, and to get so focused on the “what is” that we forget about the “what could be”. Sometimes we just need someone to come alongside us whose eyes aren’t clouded by the fog of the current situation, someone who can bring clarity and help us see the possibilities, someone who can help us find our way back to a path that leads to a desirable destination.

As we serve our communities that is our approach. We come alongside people and help them see all their options so they can choose the best path. Sometimes they are young people at the trailhead of life simply deciding what paths they want to explore. They can see all their options and the possibilities, they just need a little guidance in choosing their path. Other times we see people who have chosen a path and are now second guessing their decision. They’ve lost hope, lost sight of what could be, and are letting their current situations define and limit them.

At Clarity, we’ve each experienced times like this, times when we didn’t know which path to choose, or times when we got caught up in our circumstances and began to let them determine our path. However, through our own personal experience, we’ve discovered that there is hope. With a little help, we’re able to lift our eyes and look beyond our current situation, seeing the possibilities ahead and being reassured that we can choose a better path, no matter where we are on the journey.

A natural and effective method that uses a smart algorithm to learn your cycle and identify your ovulation by analyzing your basal body temperature. Natural Cycles is for women over the age of 18. Natural Cycles does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Natural Cycles is only available as a method of birth control in the USA and Europe. In countries outside the USA and Europe, Natural Cycles is intended to be used for fertility monitoring.

Natural Cycles is 93% effective under typical use, which means that 7 women out of 100 get pregnant during 1 year of use.* No method of contraception is 100% effective, even when using the app perfectly you can still have an unintended pregnancy.

Natural Cycles shows you:
○ How your unique cycle works
○ Daily updates on where you are in your cycle
○ When you are in the fertile phase of your cycle and need to use protection (e.g. condoms)
○ When your ovulation is detected and predicted
○ When your period is coming up and when you can expect PMS
○ The science behind your menstrual cycle

Natural Cycles is:
○ The only digital method of birth control available in both the USA and Europe
○ Backed by clinical research
○ CE marked & FDA cleared

Pricing Plans:
To use the app you need a two-decimal basal thermometer. 

Yearly plan: 79.99 USD/year. Free thermometer included.
Monthly plan: 9.99 USD/ month. Thermometer not included.
Free trial: 30 day free trial. Thermometer not included.

Precautions:
○ As a contraceptive, Natural Cycles may be less suitable for you if you have irregular menstrual cycles (i.e. cycles shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days) and/or fluctuating temperatures as predicting fertility is more difficult in these circumstances. Natural Cycles’ effectiveness as a contraceptive is not affected by irregular cycles, but you will experience an increased number of red days, which can reduce your satisfaction with Natural Cycles.
○ Natural Cycles does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Use a condom to protect against STIs.

A society where the gospel of Jesus Christ reigns in the heart of all, resulting in lifestyle changes that transform our culture into one that recognizes the sanctity of human life, reinforces the biblical family unit and rejects abortion.

Ministry Scripture
""The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.""  John 10:10 (NIV)
Statement of Faith

    We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative word of God.
    We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His vicarious atoning death and through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father and in His personal return in power and glory.
    We believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential and that this salvation is received through faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord and not as a result of good works.
    We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a Godly life and perform good works.
    We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved into the resurrection of life and they are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.
    We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.

The application every man must have!

- The great period tracker on the AppStore that you can trust.
- The only application with correct gender prediction algorithm.

* SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH *

The application uses real scientific research of R. Guerrero, 1974 to predict gender of a baby. It’s based on real statistics of thousands and thousands women. As opposed to it the widely-spread Landrum Shettles method is based only on theory and totally incorrect.

* HOW TO USE *

To generate your ovulation calendar you should provide the following details:

- Date of the last period (on the calendar on the main tab).
- Average length of the periods (on Settings tab).
- Length of the Luteal Phase (on Settings tab or use default value).

The application works best for women with regular menstrual cycles, the average cycle length is also a valid way to predict when the ovulation should happen.","iPhone5-iPhone5,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

If a person is suffering from OCD, during pregnancy these symptoms may change and/or feel more intense. Also the topics of OCD thoughts often change because of pregnancy. Because I have so much experience in helping pregnant women recover from OCD, I think it is important to share my knowledge with you, my reader.

In this book we will talk about different types of OCD that are commonly experienced by expectant mothers, we will talk about how the symptoms change throughout the pregnancy, during the birthing process and after the birth. 

Most importantly, I will show you a clear plan of getting over OCD. Please use the workbook portion of this book to put everything you learn into practice.  If you work on your recovery every day from now on, I promise you that you will see results and you will fully recover. It will take dedication and hard work, but I know that you are strong and you can do this.


My OCD Story

I have been suffering with OCD for many years before I created a method of how to get over it. I am not a doctor. I am not a professional writer. I hope you keep this second part in mind as you read this book. This is not a book to read and put away. I have helped many people get over OCD and I can tell you that this method works as long as you apply it. 

When I was suffering with OCD I never thought I would get over it. I could not even imagine that not only I would get over it, but I would be helping others with it as well. You can get over this. You can recover. You just need to learn how and apply what you learn.","iPhone4-iPhone4,iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

Their results were published as the “Social Readjustment Rating Scale” (SRRS), known more commonly as the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale. Subsequent validation has supported the links between stress and illness.

Dot uses a patent-pending approach to identify your pregnancy risk for each day of your cycle and tells you if it’s a High, Medium, or Low risk day for pregnancy.

Dot requires only your period start dates to produce accurate and personalized information.  The Dot fertility tracker app (free) can be used as a period tracker, fertility calendar, period calendar, period calculator, and ovulation calculator.

Dot fertility tracker has been described by global health experts as a ""game changer for women's health"".

DOT FERTILITY TRACKER GETS SMARTER WITH USE
Dot’s proprietary algorithm uses ongoing statistical analysis to determine your pregnancy chances for each day of your cycle.  The more dates you enter, the more tailored Dot’s results. Whether you are using it as a period tracker, fertility monitor, or ovulation predictor.

HOW IS DOT FERTILITY TRACKER DIFFERENT?
Dot fertility tracker is more advanced than a period tracker. It gives you accurate information that can be used to prevent pregnancy or get pregnant fast. And it’s easier to use than traditional fertility awareness methods. No need for extensive charting and daily temperature taking, whether you use it as birth control or for conception.

Dot has been tested extensively for accuracy.  Dot fertility tracker is based on years of research and is undergoing the first contraceptive efficacy study on a fertility app.

WHO CAN USE DOT FERTILITY TRACKER?
Anyone can use Dot as a menstrual cycle tracker, period tracker, or to get pregnant. If you use Dot for pregnancy prevention, it is recommended that you have cycles between 20-40 days long with less than 10 days variation in length. Dot will let you know if your cycles are ever outside this range. Additionally, it is recommended that users should be able to manage their fertile days by using an effective back-up birth control method or avoiding intercourse on high-risk days.

DOT FERTILITY TRACKER FEATURES
• Tailored information – Dot gives you tailored information based on your cycle data that you can use as a fertility tracker to get pregnant, to avoid pregnancy, or just as a health tracker and period tracker.

• Fertility Monitor – Dot lets you instantly know if you are on a High, Medium or Low-risk day for pregnancy. It’s like having a fertility friend in your pocket.

• Ovulation Predictor – Dot identifies the day you are statistically most likely to ovulate.

• Period Tracker & Predictions – Dot isn’t just a period calendar, it’s a period predictor. Dot gives you accurate menstrual cycle predictions for the next 6 months letting you know when to expect your flo!

• Health Tracker – Dot lets you know if your cycle pattern indicates a possible underlying health issue that should be addressed. It monitors your menstrual cycle for possible irregularities that could be an indication of health concerns such as PCOS.

• PMS Tracker, Mood Tracker, & More - Add notes to calendar dates and track your period symptoms, mood, and frequency of sex.

• Data Security – Your data resides on your phone, not with us! You can export and save your cycle data.

OPTIONAL DOT PRO UPGRADE
When you upgrade to Dot Pro, you are helping the millions of women around the world who have an unmet need for contraception. We are committed to providing women with free, effective family planning options that don’t cause side effects. Upgrading to Dot Pro supports this work. Upgrading also gives you a few nifty features!

From the most comprehensive food list in the app store, we make it super quick and easy to determine which foods are considered safe or unsafe to consume while pregnant. 

Our food safety information is supported by the following organizations: American Pregnancy Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Livestrong

Being pregnant is hard work, especially when it comes to protecting and nourishing your developing baby. You are now ""eating for two"", or maybe eight (evidently, it can happen)! The things you consume you can have a profound effect on the safety and development of your little one. 

Although some foods are safe and nutritious, others have the ability to negatively affect your pregnancy. Let us help you take the mystery out of eating, the thing you do multiple times every day.  

SafeToEat was built by a couple fortunate enough to have experienced the challenge of healthy food selection during two pregnancies. This is the app we needed to survive and keep the taste buds alive.

Things you need to do in preparation for it can be quite a journey - full of excitement and joy, intermingle with feelings of uncertainty, not because it is difficult, but simply you haven't done it before. The days just before the birth, waiting for the contractions and counting the contractions is one of those things. 

This app does one thing only: it helps you keep track of your contractions just before the birth of your baby. It is written in anticipation of the birth of my own daughter. It is sort of my little effort to help my wife. It helps her, so hopefully it can help other expecting mothers too. Best wishes.

Features:
- Keep track of the start and finish time of each contraction.
- The app will tell you the duration of each contraction and also the duration between one contraction and the next one.
- You can enter the start and finish time manually or there is an easy to use timer for that. (It is actually best if you use the timer.)
- In addition to working out the durations, the app will also let you know:
a. The highest number of contractions per hour recorded so far
b. When you have reached a given number of contraction of a certain duration each (e.g. 5 contractions of 45 seconds duration each in an hour) - this can be customised to your situation based on advice from your doctor or hospital.","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

The 10-question Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a valuable and efficient way of identifying patients at risk for postpartum depression. The EPDS self-screening test is easy to administer and has proven to be an effective screening tool for PPD.
Instructions for Moms: 
1. The mother is asked to select the response that comes closest to how she has been feeling in the previous 7 days.
2. All 10 questions must be answered.
3. Care should be taken to avoid the possibility of the mother discussing her answers with others.
4. The mother should complete the scale herself, unless she has limited English or has difficulty with reading.
5. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale may be used at 6-8 weeks postpartum with repetition between 3-6 months to screen for PPD. The minimum time period to retake the EPDS test is two weeks. The child health clinic, a postnatal checkup, or a home visit may provide a suitable opportunity for its completion as the mom can take the test in private.

While you’re sleeping, the Ava bracelet tracks 9 health parameters also associated with varying levels of progesterone and estradiol throughout the menstrual cycle. 
The Ava bracelet is a completely unprecedented method of tracking a woman’s cycle and health.

HOW AVA WORKS:
While you’re sleeping, Ava’s sensors collect data on nine different physiological parameters. 
- Skin temperature
- Pulse rate
- Breathing rate
- Heart rate variability ratio
- Perfusion
- Movement
- Heat loss
- Bio impedance
- Sleep duration and sleep phases

The parameters are fed into our algorithm in order to determine your fertile window. Other methods of fertility tracking rely on only a single parameter, and thus cannot provide a complete picture of your fertility in real time. Ava detects the very first signs that the fertile window is beginning, and confirms when it ends. Ava, in addition keeps tracking your data once you are pregnant and accompanies you on your journey.

WITH AVA YOU CAN: 
+ See 5.3 fertile days per cycle in real time.
+ Track your temperature, resting pulse rate, sleep quality and quantity and physiological stress levels.
+ Gain insights about your menstrual cycle and discover patterns in your health over time with charts, graphs, and trend analysis.
+ Learn about changes in your body during pregnancy.

THE SCIENCE BEHIND AVA:
+ Ava has been shown to detect an average of 5.3 fertile days per cycle at 89% accuracy. 
+ Ava was clinically tested in a year-long study at the University Hospital of Zurich under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Brigitte Leeners, the leading expert on the mathematical modeling of menstrual cycles.
+ Ava is an FDA registered device and CE certified. 

AVA BRACELET & AVA APP:
The Ava Bracelet is made with the most advanced Swiss sensor technology. It provides health insight that’s not available with any other wearable health tracker and identifies more fertile days per cycle than any other method. The app must be used with the Ava bracelet.

Created by leading clinical hypnotherapists Sue Peckham and James Holmes, this app can be used by mother and partner throughout the last few weeks of pregnancy to prepare for your baby’s birth and during labour to aid relaxation and release tension as you give birth to your baby.

Less tension means less pain and a more relaxed birthing experience for mother and baby. Your EasyBirth hypnosis sessions will help you to experience a reduction in stress and tension making childbirth a joyful experience for mother, partner and baby.

Easybirth helps you to have a more comfortable birth as powerful suggestions help you to feel calm and in control.  You will experience deeply relaxing hypnotherapy sessions that you will find empowering and which allow your mind and body to work together to ensure the most natural birth possible for your baby.

Your Easybirth app will help you to feel more comfortable and relaxed yet in full control as your baby is born. Many users have reported a shortened time in labour as a result of using their Easybirth Childbirth session during their labour.
Listening to your EasyBirth hypnosis sessions helps you to create a calm and peaceful atmosphere for both you and your birth partner so that you can both share in this wonderful experience.

At all times you will have complete control over your body and the level of relaxation that you want to achieve.  You will be in control of your body’s own natural anaesthesia ensuring that your mind and body will work in harmony as your baby comes into the world.
During your Easybirth hypnosis sessions you will be fully aware of everything that is going on around you. You will feel relaxed and in control.  Your subconscious mind will accept only those suggestions which will be of benefit to you.

The most simple app for your pregnancy, user friendly and only useful information. 
Every week we bring information on the child's growth (text & pictures), passing from the state of embryo to fetus, describing the development of internal organs, limbs, skin, sensory organs, etc. 

1. Introduction: 
When you first start the program it briefly describes its content. To start you must select the mode you prefer among ACCOMPANYING (information will be provided each week with the progress of gestation, and you can also view the previous weeks) and CONSULTATION (you have free access to all content immediately). 
Each time you start the application in ACCOMPANYING start mode, which is recommended because it gives the most fun in the sense that you can see the following contents only when you enter the next week of pregnancy. 
As a second step, you must also enter data on the ""My Dates"" depending on whether the pregnancy is already in progress or you are planning one. 

2. The sex of the unborn child: 
In this window you can perform a statistical calculation on the alleged sex of the unborn child; in fact several international studies show that the sex of the child depends to some extent also on the last full relationship in relation to the date of ovulation of the woman. This for several factors affects the mobility and lifetime of sperm depending on whether carriers of chromosomes X or Y and the acidity of the uterus of the woman after ovulation. 
Inserting the date of last relationship prior to ovulation, it is possible to give a probability value to the child's sex. Of course, this result should be regarded as purely probabilistic. 

3. Pregnancy information 
Once the data are entered as indicated above, the program automatically offers information on the current week of pregnancy, showing general information on child development and changes occurring in the mother. 
Each week is also associated with one or more explanatory images, drawings and photographs. 
If you have chosen the ACCOMPANYING mode during the start of the program, you can only see the information relating to the week of pregnancy and during the previous week. At anytime you can still switch to consultation, and have access to all content, set on the Info page of the program. 
For women who are not pregnant, in ACCOMPANYING mode you can only view information about the first week of gestation, remaining always possible to change mode from the INFO page. 
The program provides information for all 40 weeks of pregnancy.","iPhone3GS-iPhone-3GS,iPhone4-iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen-iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

You will also be able to individually see the clubs that you are a member of or those you've started yourself.

You can chat in the same club with the participants by adding chat topics into the club. If you wish, you can message individually by adding people as friends. Whenever you wish, you can create an invitation in the ""My invitations"" section and send these to your friends. In the inbox, you can find incoming messages and notifications, see friend requests and incoming invitations, write and send new messages.

Thanks to the '' Water Counter '', you can record in this application every glass of water you drink, you can see how much of your daily water needs are met. It warns you if you drink too much or too little. The She Pregnant continues to be with you at this stage to spend your pregnancy in the healthiest way.

A genetic disorder is a disease caused by a different form of a gene called a variation, or an alteration of a gene called a mutation.  Many diseases have a genetic aspect.  Some, including many cancers, are caused by a mutation in a gene or group of genes in a person's cells.  These mutations can occur randomly or because of an environmental exposure such as cigarette smoke.

Other genetic disorders are inherited.  A mutated gene is passed down through a family and each generation of children can inherit the gene that causes the disease.  Still other genetic disorders are due to problems with the number of packages of genes called chromosomes.  In Down syndrome, for example, there is an extra copy of chromosome 21.

This cool app discusses the most important topics in genetic disorders and is ideal for all medical professionals, medical residents and interns, nurses, medical students,  and of course curious lay people who just want to learn more about genetic disorders.

Health benefits of water?

Water is your body's principal chemical component and makes up about 60 percent of your body weight. Every system in your body depends on water. For example, water flushes toxins out of vital organs, carries nutrients to your cells, and provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues.

Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry out normal functions. Even mild dehydration can drain your energy and make you tired.

How much water do you need?

Every day you lose water through your breath, perspiration, urine and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you must replenish its water supply by consuming beverages and foods that contain water.

So how much fluid does the average, healthy adult living in a temperate climate need? The Institute of Medicine determined that an adequate intake (AI) for men is roughly about 13 cups (3 liters) of total beverages a day. The AI for women is about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of total beverages a day.

Once you have entered just a small amount of data (for example, the date of your last period and your normal cycle length), the application calculates a whole range of details: Your (likely) due date, the progress of your pregnancy, your current week of gestation, and the number of days to the birth of your child.

The calculation can be carried out also using your due date and the day of ovulation.

In the detailed view you get every week a brief information and a picture of the development stage of your baby. Whenever you want, you can scroll backwards through the weekly information; however, you can only scroll two weeks into the future.

Below you will find detailed information about each week of pregnancy.
Additionally, you can add your own notes and images (eg ultrasound images or photos) to each day.","iPhone4-iPhone4,iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

If you are pregnant, it is important to keep moving. Pregnant women who get enough exercise have less back pain and more energy. Post-deliver you will return faster to your pre-pregnancy shape.

The app contains exercises suitable for pregnant women.
The exercises are done at home by using dumbbells, a body band (dynaband, or resistance band) and an exercise ball (Swiss ball).

Even as a beginner you can perform each exercise in this app.

Strengthen your body for pregnancy and beyond with these safe exercises you can most likely do right up until the day you deliver. As long as you take the necessary precautions and use good technique (meaning slow, controlled movements), weight training is a great way to tone and strengthen your muscles. Building strength during pregnancy will help prepare you for all the baby lifting you'll be doing soon!

Regular exercise as a pregnant woman will:
- Help you to carry the weight you gain in pregnancy.
- Prepare you for the physical challenge of labour and birth.

Using the app you can more exactly predict the gender of your unborn child. There are a lot of methods of planning the gender of your unborn child: ""Chinese Gender Predictor"", ""Blood renewal"", ""Japanese method"", ""By parents' blood types"", etc. 
    “I am pregnant! What’s next?” - There always is time when every woman asks herself this question. You’ve eventually passed through the planning of your baby’s birth, and now you’re pregnant at last. But there is still remains the main question: “Who?” Boy or girl? Adorable daughter or smart son? Chinese gender predictor along with another methods of this app will help you to predict the gender of your unborn baby before it would be possible by ultrasound investigation.
    What approaches does this application consist? 
    1. Blood renewal. It is believed that the blood of a man is refreshed during every fourth year of his life, and a woman’s on every third. At the time of conception, the person whose blood is younger (dad or mum) determines the sex of a baby.
    2. By parents' blood types. People have little marker things called antigens on the surface of their red blood cells. The two most important ones are AB0 system antigens and the Rh system. The combination of parents' blood types defines the possibility of birth children with different gender.
    3. Chinese Gender Predictor. This approach uses information about age of future mother and when she got pregnant. Legend says the chart is more than 700 years old and was discovered in a royal tomb.

The arrival of a baby is a wonderful time!  When a new baby comes into the world, it’s a miracle.  During the delivery, the focus is on the woman.  After all she’s the one feeling the pain, right? What about the father? Often he’s uncertain of his role. Men in the delivery room have their own issues and they’ll be addressed in this app.

First though, remember back in time, when men weren’t allowed in the delivery room?  Guys were relegated to the waiting room, left to pace the floor as they waited for their children to be born.  Thankfully there’s been a shift in tradition. Now over 90 percent of dads are right there with their partner encouraging her on. 

Today men’s only role isn’t just during conception; they share the entire experience of pregnancy. Joining in on the excitement, choosing nursery furniture, picking out names, and taking Lamaze and parenting classes.  Even with this involvement, when it comes time for the nitty gritty business of getting that baby out – it can still be overwhelming. If you feel out of place and nervous during the birth, imagine all the men who are be welcomed to see the birth that aren’t the father. With the advent of birthing rooms, the door is now wide open for all sorts of men to see this miracle. It’s common for uncles, grandfathers, brothers and male friends to be invited in. So if you’re male, you’d best read on.","iPhone3GS-iPhone-3GS,iPhone4-iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen-iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

Приложение FEIA Детско развитие е разработено съвместно с екип лекари, психолози и педагози, за да бъде в помощ на родителите при отглеждането на техните деца.
Не се лутайте в хилядите страници специализирана литература за детско развитие, не харчете излишни пари за много думи и малко информация. Доверете се на FEIA – тя е само на клик разстояние.
Бъдете модерен родител и използвайте интерактивните възможности, които FEIA предоставя, по всяко време и навсякъде.
FEIA Детско развитие проследява най-важните моменти от развитието на вашето дете през първите 5 години от живота му. Съдържанието е структурирано по месеци, което позволява на родителите да следят лесно развитието на детето и да подбират подходящи ласки, игри и методи за възпитание. Интерфейсът предоставя възможност за отбелязване на постигнатите резултати.
Активен родител
Ролята на родителите за умственото, емоционалното и физическото развитие на детето до навършване на 5 годишна възраст е определяща. Социалните навици и възпитанието започват да се формират още от първите месеци. Раздел „Активен родител“ помага в подбирането на подходящи игри и занимания, съобразени с конкретната възраст на детето. Ще откриете разпределени по месеци важни напътствия и съвети, активности и игри, стимулиращи интелектуалното, двигателното и емоционалното развие на вашето дете. Ще се научите последователно да прилагате подходящи методи за възпитание и да общувате с вашето растящо дете.
Говорете с лекаря ако
Редовните консултации с педиатъра са изключително важни, за да бъде проследено правилно ли протича развитието на детето. В секция „Говорете с лекаря ако“ ще откриете по месеци активностите, за чието усвояване трябва да следите. Това ще помогне да формулирате правилно въпросите си към вашия лекар. Ако забележите, че детето не се справя с някои от посочените умения, изпитва сериозни затруднения или забравя вече наученото, може да обсъдите притесненията си с педиатъра.
Ежедневни дейности
Докато расте детето променя своето отношение към ежедневните дейности, които извършва заедно с родителите си – къпане, хранене, преобличане, приспиване. В секция „Ежедневни дейности“ ще откриете по месеци какви трябва да бъдат неговите реакции към рутинните активности и в каква степен то може самостоятелно да участва в тях. Това дава възможност да се проследи умственото, емоционалното и физическото развитие да детето.
Координация
Опити за координация на движенията у детето ще забележите от самото начало – например поднасянето на ръчички към устичката. С всеки изминал месец двигателната способност се променя и координацията се подобрява, а с помощта на тази секция родителите имат възможност по месеци да проследят развитието ѝ у своето дете.
Себеизразяване
През различните периоди на своя растеж, детето дава различни сигнали, с които показва какво иска и как се чувства - дали е щастливо, гладно, раздразнено или му се спи. По начина, по който то изразява себе си, родителите могат да проследят неговото емоционално развитие.
Социални умения
Социалните умения на детето се проявяват още от първите месеци, когато започва да гука игриво и да забелязва шумове. Постепенно и с помощта на родители, детето започва да общува с заобикалящия го свят, да взаимодейства с хора и свои връстници, да забелязва предмети, да проявява предпочитания към вкусове, миризми и игри. В секция „Социални умения“ родителите ще получат информация какви социални умения трябва да очакват и настърчават у своето дете, съобразно възрастта му по месеци.
Приложение FEIA Детско развитие не замества редовните визити при педиатъра на детето. Не се притеснявайте ако то не извършва някое от описаните в приложението действия. Важна е общата тенденция в развитието му. Ако детето не е усвоило описаните умения или имате притеснения, че не усвоява част от тях, консултирайте се с педиатър.","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

Pregnancy music is a free music app which contains the best collection of music for pregnancy and unborn baby.
Pregnancy music will help you increase a healthier and stress - free birth experience.

Benefits of listening pregnancy music during pregnancy
- Mellows down your agitated mind and soothes your senses in a unique way!
- Reduces the stress and anxiety
- Helps with the depression that many pregnant women experience
- Stimulates brain function in developing infants
- Improves comprehension of exact sciences and many others
- Make your baby smarter

You should play this pregnancy music any time you relaxing. 
Just turn volume lower than 65 decibels (dB) when play music for pregnancy about as loud as background music at the store – because that may hurt or startle the baby. And if you're listening to music for pregnancy for prolonged periods, it's best to keep the volume below 50 dB (the sound level in most neonatal intensive care units).

Decibel levels of common household sounds are:
50 - 75 dB washing machine.
55 - 70 dB dishwasher.
60 - 85 dB vacuum cleaner.
60 - 95 dB hair dryer.
65 - 80 dB alarm clock.
75 - 85 dB flush toilet.
80 dB ringing telephone.

We encourage informed decision making by providing evidence-based education on parenting, abortion, and adoption so each person can explore all possible options before making a final decision - a decision they will live with for the rest of their lives.

In these crisis situations, abortion is frequently chosen because women feel there is no other alternative. Ninety-one percent of women interviewed at an abortion clinic said that if they had felt an alternative was available, they would not have chosen abortion.

TPHC is a locally organized and funded non-profit organization. It is governed by a local Board of Directors and managed by a Director who carries out the activities of the Center through staff and trained volunteers. Our outreach is built on love, support, and compassionate education women (and men) need to carefully consider all of their options.

Pregnancy is hard. Smells Fishy isn't. That's why we designed Smells Fishy to be the easiest and fastest way to access information about seafood mercury levels.  You can quickly swipe to see how each seafood ranks in mercury content from Least to Highest. You can even do a live search to quickly get the information when you need it.

But we know it's important to eat fish because of their Omega-3 fatty acid content, which are super important for a healthy pregnancy. That's why we integrated official USDA nutrition information so you can sort by the seafood that ranks highest in a vitamin, mineral, and proximate ... including Omega-3's.

And with 68 different fish and mollusks, Smells Fishy gives you in-depth details such as how to prepare your seafood as well as any other additional risks you should be aware of.

Stop carrying around a printed card with seafood mercury levels or trying to remember it. Download Smells Fishy just for the halibut! (get it?)

Futurize is your time case to reopen in a day or 20 years.
Fill it with thoughts, images and sounds, day after day. Then send it in the future. Those who receive it will take back that time that you have lived or dedicated to it.

Futurize is a new way to leave a trace and send it in the future, to whoever you want, when you want.
As in one of those boxes we had as children, you can decide to keep in the """"box"""" of our days, your smartphone, a diary made of thoughts, photos, videos, content ... make it travel in time ... and deliver it to the recipient.

You can give your children and your grandchildren the moments lived today with them. Or immortalize a period spent with your friends and relive it in ten years. Unveil behind-the-scenes time for an important appointment. See you again with your school friends, now adults, in that unforgettable vacation after high school.
Put aside, for a moment, the social networks you use every day. The contents of Futurize are accessible only to those who fill the box of memories until you send it to the future. Since then it will travel over time, up to the date of delivery.

- PRESERVE MOMENTS: Create one or more time cases dedicated to those who want. Record thoughts and moments, small and big things, capture memories ... you can assign it to yourself or someone else.

- INVITE: you can write the diary alone or with other people. Only those invited can do it with you.

- DIARY OR MEMORY BOX: you can choose to create a diary with an intuitive Timeline in chronological sequence, with your posts and multimedia content, or a Memory Box in which to keep moments untied by time.

- DELIVERY IN THE FUTURE: Choose which date to deliver your memories to the recipient and indicate an email address to which to get the notification. You can choose to indicate more addresses for the same box to send it to more people or for deliveries in time, to be sure of the reception. You can appoint a """"Custodian"""" who, without access to the diary, will have the task of verifying the recipient's e-mail address.

- STAMP. Apply a stamp to have the diary delivered on the date indicated. You can buy the stamp from the time of creation of the diary (recommended for deliveries far in time) or when you futurize it. Futurizing the diary means sending it in the future, just like posting a letter, but in the dimension of time.

Affirmations and meditations for a peaceful pregnancy
 
Affirmations and meditation can play an enormous role in supporting you to be calm and empowered throughout the ups and downs of pregnancy. By actively encouraging your mind to focus on and create positive approaches to pregnancy, you are giving yourself and your baby the very best chance to enjoy a more relaxed and loving time as you grow together.
 
Why use affirmations and meditation?

Trying for a baby and being pregnant can be one of the most wonderful and exciting times of a woman’s life. Conception and pregnancy can be challenging for your body as you do your best to create a healthy environment to grow a baby. Maintaining a peaceful and positive mindset can be difficult as you deal with symptoms and the uncertainty of giving birth and changing your lifestyle.


What are affirmations?

Affirmations are things that we say, think or feel about ourselves and our lives which we believe to be true. They can have very powerful effects on our lives in either positive or negative ways.


Benefits of affirmations

With positive affirmations, you can shape your experience of life and opinions of yourself that empower you to be happy and successful. The affirmations in this app are designed to help you create an inspiring, loving and gentle approach towards yourself, your baby and your pregnancy. Use them every day to give yourself a new perspective or emotional support, especially when dealing with the challenges of being pregnant. 


Benefits of meditation

Mediation during pregnancy is a great way to reduce stress, give your mind and body an opportunity to relax, refresh and to connect emotionally and spiritually with your baby. When you meditate, you can help yourself to let go of concerns and focus on the well-being yourself and your baby. Regular meditation breaks can vastly improve your mental and emotional ability to deal with challenges and maintain confidence and inner peace.

Everything flows more easily in your body when you are deeply relaxed. Mediation is known to lower your blood pressure, slow and deepen your breathing, release tension in muscles and organs and improve the quality of your sleep. Use these meditations whenever you feel stressed, tired or just open to enjoying a new, beautiful experience with your baby.","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

The name options appear endless and different people have very different tastes. That you’ve probably gathered already by talking with your partner about the future baby’s name. Making a decision is not straightforward, but it’s not overwhelmingly impossible either. 
Our baby-name-App searches and filters for you over 3000 names through a wide variety of search criteria. In addition it provides a good coverage of background knowledge of the names, which will help you in making the final choice. 

Here's how the App works
Baby’s gender is the first step in narrowing down the choice of a name. In addition, the first name should sound good together with the surname. Enter the future baby’s surname and let our App search first names which will make a good match. 

A further instrument for a harmonious sounding full name is the length of the first name. You can play around with different options by clicking the “Further search criteria” and then you’ll get a better idea what you really want. The cultural origin of the name obviously relates to the sound of the name. For example German names and Irish names have distinctive sounds to them. If you have a preference for a particular cultural background, you can choose from a menu in the App. You can also search through biblical names. You can mark the names which you like with a star and make a list of favorites. With the help of that list you can further research the details of each name and share the information with other people. 

If you already have a name in mind, you can find it from the alphabetical index and learn more about its cultural origin, the meaning of the name and how popular it is. As the popular Latin proverb states: “Nomen est omen!” – the name is an omen. 

That said, we wish you good luck and hope you have fun when being on a quest for the perfect name for your baby.

Music for Pregnancy is a hand-picked collection of classical music that 
will help you increase a healthier and stress-free birth experience!

Why is it IMPORTANT to listen to classical music during pregnancy?

Classical music may REDUCE the stress, anxiety, and depression that many 
pregnant women experience. That's a fact! It is also very propitious for 
the fetus as it offers a range of notes and tends to repeat, creating an 
almost lullaby style sound in the womb.

You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   

It contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.

Then for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.

Finally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.

As an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.

Mommy just gave birth to triplet baby after her pregnancy surgery at the hospital. It will be really hard for mommy to handle the baby care alone so you have to help her out in taking care of her triplet baby and babysit them with her.

Triplet baby means three babies, all new born, that too after a recent childbirth. This means it is really hard on mommy to give proper baby care now alone. Daddy is not here right now so he can’t help mommy with triplet baby new born childbirth baby care. Now it is up to you to relieve mommy from childbirth stress.  

Give mommy a break from her new born childbirth baby care routine and see how it works to take care of babies through baby games. This way you can turn the content of the game from baby to also mom care because in a way when you do baby care you also do mom care since you’re shouldering her troubles. 

Now that you have taken over as the babysitter at baby care day care there are things you need to do for mommy and baby hospital nursery care game. The most important step is to provide the baby with food on time because food is the essential of every human being and a baby will cry if he doesn’t get food on time. 

Since the baby is little there’s not much he can eat. There are a lot of options to choose from. The food items in the game include;
- baby food
- cereal 
- juice
- fruits 
- vegetables
- donuts

All food items are made to fit the triplet baby diet and tendency to eat their baby food. 

Baby food is essential because baby food contains all the compressed nutrients that we can’t give to babies in its raw form since it is solid and the triplet can’t chew on it. So make sure to give triplet baby their baby food. Baby food is essential. 

In your triplet baby nursery day care baby care babysitting course, the next step is cleaning which means bathing the triplet baby. IT is bath time!! First of all the baby diaper needs to be changed so that the triplet baby can be ready for their shower time. Give them a shower in a row. The bath tub scene includes;
- shampoo 
- soap 
- then towelling 
- whilst the triplet baby play with toys. 

After the cleaning bathing it’s time for pampering in which the triplet baby need to be dressed up for a good night. This includes; 
- putting on new diaper 
- baby powder
- give them either a pacifier or a feeder 
- then put on dressing 

You can get toys for the triplet baby by using game coins you will earn through different activities in the game. 

And lastly, is the sleeping time. Set the triplet baby is their bed, give them their pacifier, cover them in a blanket and turn the lights off. That concludes your baby care of the day. 
Thank you for helping mommy in her process of every day baby care. She is really happy to have a helping hand in her triplet baby, baby care routine. 

You can join in again any time for more baby care to help the mommy as much as you want!!

Here you will find a pregnancy quiz with 15 questions, which correspond to the main early signs of pregnancy and with which you will obtain an approximate percentage, which can serve as an orientation to know whether you are pregnant.

If you ask yourself: Am I pregnant? In this case, the best idea is to go to a professional doctor or a pharmacy to do a pregnancy test, but if you want to have an approximate orientation before going, you can do the ""Am I pregnant quiz"" we have prepared.

Main characteristics:
- Before the first signs of pregnancy, if you want to know the approximate possibility to become pregnant, you can use this pregnancy test calculator to eliminate your doubts.
- It is an online pregnancy test, focused on 15 questions about the signs of early pregnancy during the first weeks, which will give you a guiding result.
- If you are tired of home pregnancy tests, you can try to take this questionnaire. You will have an approximate result by only responding to some simple questions related to the early pregnancy signs in first weeks of pregnancy.

Which kind of questions will you find in this home pregnancy test?
As we have explained before, all questions are focused on early pregnancy symptoms. Therefore, you will find some questions related to fatigue, irritability, sickness or vomiting, appetite, heartburn, constipation, etc. In short, a collection of the most relevant questions to be able to have an orientation about your situation.
If you ask yourself how to know whether you are pregnant, this app will help you to shed some light and have a rough idea. We hope that this free pregnancy test helps you in discovering a positive or negative pregnancy test result or whatever you are looking for.
If, on the contrary, you want to know how to get pregnant, this is not the aim of this app, therefore we recommend you to search for other apps or information of a professional doctor, since the aim of this app is to check your pregnancy status when having some sign of pregnancy to know whether you are pregnant or not.

Note: This app is not a reliable pregnancy test, but simply a questionnaire to obtain an approximate result, but never definite. It is important that you go to the doctor or pharmacy for a 100% reliable result when experiencing signs of being pregnant.

Fitness
The best motivation during your fitness journey is seeing your results. Watch as your body changes over time! With Evolved, watch your weight melt off and your muscles morph into shape. Take a photo everyday, motivating you to stay on track, reaching your fitness goals. An Evolved animated GIF or video is the ultimate ‘before and after’ transformation. 

Children
You can still have your child stand by the wall to measure and mark their growth, but why not take a picture too? Take a picture each month, add their age and height, and watch them sprout up! From your baby's first year, through their childhood, to adulthood, these animated images and videos will be priceless. And don't worry; Evolved will remind you to take the photos regularly at the intervals you set. 

Maternity
Maternity photos are great keepsakes for both you and your children. Use Evolved to capture your baby bump and you'll have a whole new perspective on life. Take a picture each day or once a week for those nine months and then create your animated GIF or video. Witness your own development throughout your maternity. You can view it at three months, six months, nine months, after you’ve had the baby, or whenever you want. Now that's a maternity photo! 

There are so many exciting ways people are using Evolved, from gentlemen growing out their beards, to ladies changing their look over time, to people watching their process of aging. Observing your evolution is fun, interesting and easy—especially once you’ve Evolved!","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

Classical music has been proven to be the music of intelligence. Recent studies have shown that listening to classical music can have lasting effects on one's brain; it can stimulate brain function in developing infants and improve comprehension of math and other computing skills in adults. It trains the brain to acknowledge all the parts that work together to make the whole. 

Why is it IMPORTANT to listen to classical music during pregnancy? 
Classical music may REDUCE the stress, anxiety, and depression that many pregnant women experience. That's a fact! It is also very propitious for the fetus as it offers a range of notes and tends to repeat, creating an almost lullaby style sound in utero. 

CLASSICAL MUSIC FOR MOMMIES EFFECTS: 
- Mellows down your agitated mind and soothes your senses in a unique way! 
- Reduces the stress and anxiety 
- Helps with the depression that many pregnant women experience 
- Stimulates brain function in developing infants 
- Improves comprehension of exact sciences and many others ;) 

NOTE: The effects are more pronounced when you submerge yourself completely into the music and listen to it religiously without diverting your mind anywhere else.","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

The app is developed by midwives with vast experience with waterbirths, both in clinical practice and in education of midwifery students. The app provides you with inspiration and clinical tips for your daily practice as a midwife.

Warm water is relaxing and reduces labour pains. It is affordable, non-invasive and has no side effects. Women, who give birth in water, often express great satisfaction with both pain relief and birth experience.
Most women associate a warm bath with relaxation and self-care, and the feeling of being surrounded by warm water is safe and familiar. In birth, where the woman can feel insecure, safe and familiar is welcome.
The weightlessness in the water makes it easy for the woman to change positions, and changing positions can reduce labour pains and promote birth.

Functions:
•	Photos and clinical video
•	’My downloads’: Your downloaded videos and sound files, which you can also use offline.
•	Clinical tips
•	Access to a database with the latest research

Things that you need to do in preparation and on-going can be quite a journey - full of excitement and joy, intermingle with feelings of uncertainty, not because it is difficult, but simply you haven't done it before.

Many people like to keep track of what their baby has eaten and the reaction that the baby has towards different food. Such a record can form part of your baby ‘growth journal’. It can also be useful from a health management perspective as it gives you a record of what has been eaten, quantity eaten and when it has been eaten, which could be relevant information to give to your medical providers where necessary.

This app helps you track such information. It also recognises that you are busy, especially as new parents, so it is designed to be flexible and easy to use. It allows you to track the information with as little ‘click’ as possible, but, of course, if you feel like it and have more time, it allows you to enter more information.

It is written in anticipation of the birth of my own daughter. It is sort of my little effort to help my wife. It helps her, so hopefully it can help other expecting mothers too. Best wishes.

Features:
- Keep track of what you baby ate during each feed - allows you to record the type of food, quantity, time spent eating, even a photo of the food if you so wish, and the reaction to the food.
- A convenient Breast Feed function makes it easy to keep track of your Breast Feed during those early months when you are probably just Breast Feeding. It has a timer that helps you time the duration of each breast feed and also keep track of the side your baby has previously fed on.
- It has built in common food type to save you time from entering it.","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

Pregnancy and parenthood can be compatible with a successful military career when Sailors and their Commands both understand their roles and responsibilities. This app makes that task easier by including pertinent regulations, instructions and references from a variety of sources in one easy-to-use app.  

The app helps Servicemembers understand the personal and professional responsibilities that come with parenthood while serving in the Navy.

The application is divided into the following sections for ease of use: 
      > Pregnancy Guidelines, Limitations and Responsibilities. This section provides information about workplace assignments, medical considerations, pregnancy loss, abortion and related topics. It also covers medical, physical and ergonomic limitations during pregnancy, as well as ongoing responsibilities during pregnancy, including physical readiness, maternity uniforms and child care.

In addition, the app includes a Favorites section for bookmarking app pages and an Emergency section, which offers information on a variety of crisis-related topics. The Pregnancy & Parenthood app is also searchable.

OP Calendar predicts your fertility window by tracking your periods so that you can plan ahead for pregnancy. Use your fertile or less fertile days to your advantage, and take the guesswork out of family planning. 

KEY FEATURES: 
1.Easy to understand user interface 
2.Accurately predict your future periods and fertility windows 
3.Keep track of your last “fun” encounter 
4.Predict your due date if a baby was conceived 
5.Custom color choices for high and low fertility days 
6.Optional passcode to protect your privacy 

The interface is simple to understand and custom color-coded. High fertility days can be shown as green and low fertility days can be shown as red, or vice versa, depending on what is most intuitive to you. This feature is very unique, as other apps have non-custom colors that can be confusing. 

Upon inputting the beginning and end of your menstrual cycle, the app does all the complicated calculations for you so you know which days of the month you can let loose and have unprotected “fun” and which days to avoid. The app also incorporates the latest gender prediction theories to let you know which days may result in the conception of a boy or girl. 

CAUTION:

This study was far more modest than what the media made out it to be and so whether classical music really can enhance the intelligence of fully grown adults, is questionable.

Since then various other studies have concluded that pregnant women who listen to classical music, can enhance the brain of unborn babies and even infants, showing positive emotional and educational development.

Research suggests that classical songs such as the ones found on this app, help build the neural bridges along which thoughts and information travel.

Furthermore, these studies have shown it can stimulate the brain's alpha waves, which promotes a feeling of calm.

Benefits:

• Helps develop the brain power of your unborn child or young infant.

• Soothe your child in or out of the womb.

The Beginning﻿
In 1984, while attending a lecture on abortion at UVM as a third year medical student, Andy Smith realized the need of women in stressful pregnancies to be supported and cared for.

The professor’s words during the lecture inspired Andy with a vision of hope for the women of the community. Aspire Together was born out of the desire to create a place where a woman could find practical support and hope when facing an unplanned pregnancy or related concern.​

​
The Aspire Together Commitment
Regardless of a woman's decision concerning her pregnancy, Aspire Together Centers of Burlington and St. Albans offer confidential counseling, emotional and material support, and personal care beyond the woman's choice.

Aspire Together staff are dedicated to offering each client a safe, nonjudgmental, and caring experience, with medically-sourced information, referrals to community resources, material aid and more. Learn more about our services here or set up an appointment.

This groundbreaking summary audiobook puts your learning of Toddlers Are A**holes: It's Not Your Fault into Overdrive! Now for the first time you can accelerate your learning through listening to only the key principles of this book.

Learn the secrets from the masters today!

ABOUT THE BOOK:
Toddler a**holery is a normal part of human development—not unlike puberty, except this stage involves throwing food on the floor and taking swings at people who pay your way in life. For parents of toddlers, it's a ""you better laugh so you don't cry"" period.

Bunmi Laditan's hilarious, satirical guide to toddlerhood offers parents instant (and very welcome) comic relief—along with the very good news that ""It's Not Your Fault."" Chapters cover the cost of raising a toddler, feeding your toddler, potty-training, tantrums, how to manage the holidays, and ""how not to die inside."" Parents will see themselves in the very funny sections on taking your toddler to restaurants (""One parent will spend their time walking your toddler around the restaurant and outside like a cocker spaniel, while the other, luckier parent will eat alone.""), Things You Thought You'd Never Say That You Now Say As a Parent of a Toddler (""I can tell you're pooping because your eyes are watering.""), and how to order pizza (""Spend $40 on pizza delivery. Listen to your toddler cry for 30 minutes about how the pizza is all wrong. Watch your toddler take a small bite of crust. Google 'can anger give you a heart attack?' Start the bedtime routine."").

Laditan's wildly funny voice has attracted hundreds of thousands of fans of Honest Toddler on social media; here she speaks parent-to-tired-parent, easing the pains and challenges of raising toddlers with a hefty dose of adult humor and wit.

I don’t think I need to say something more if you read these reviews.

Pranayama aide with timing choice - Nice! (Jul 18, 2012) posted by Jonny0007
UPGRADED to 5 Stars! The developer added the guidance of sound-tones which was the only feature this app lacked (now you can close your eyes while you breath, if you wish). In my opinion, this breathing app is the BEST one out there IF: you want total control of the breath timing, you don't need instruction, and you don't want a lot of ""bells and whistles"" on your app. The app is simply designed and the visuals & audio foster relaxation nicely. Big thanks to the developers for the update!

Beautiful (Jun 29, 2012)  posted by Oinjjko
You could pay a lot for a breathing app and not get half of what this app gives you. Beautiful to view while you use breathing patterns you have total control over. Thank you for wonderful breathing app. Also the big timer in front of you is another beautiful feature. The timer can be displayed while doing breathing exercises or taken off the screen. The bubble audio is so relaxing, another wonderful feature. The developers got it right when they gave you total control of your breathing patterns, a lot of breathing apps don't give you this wonderful feature.

I feel grateful for these wonderful reviews. 


It has passed four years since the app was released. Version 5.0 is the first update in three years.

Now these new features are available.


Auto Stretch
You can find it in the timer setting view by pushing an clock shaped button which is located upper right.

Color Pick
Six pastel colors are set in the color buttons. But you can change the color as you like. Try long-press any color button to show a color picker.

Sound Only Mode
It was implemented in the old versions as Sleep Mode. You could breathe with sound navigation while you close your eyes, but needed to double-tap to add exhale time and single-tap to add inhale time. I loved to use the app with closed eyes, but it wasn’t comfortable. However you can use Auto stretch and Sound Only Mode at once now! Check off the box just below Auto Stretch setting pane.


I hope that you would love this version, too.


Thank you.","iPhone5-iPhone5,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

The app is designed to provide a simple, intuitive interface to the ActivAngel sensor (required for use). Our goal was to make the software as easy to use as a traditional thermometer, but with many additional benefits:

Immediate & continuous: The app connects to the sensor quickly and easily, providing accurate, immediate and continuous temperature data, without having to remember to take additional readings.
Interactive graphs: Interactive graphs make it easy to see trends and make smarter decisions. Temperature trends can be used to understand when one is getting sick, to manage health conditions. The possibilities are endless!
Customizable alerts: Smart alerts can notify one or more phones if a temperature hits a certain threshold (high or low). Parents need never again wake up in the middle of the night to wake up their children just to take their temperatures. Instead, they can catch up on their rest, confident that their phone will alert them of any important changes.
Cloud synchronization: ActivAngel securely shares temperature data among multiple devices. That allows a parent, sibling, or caregiver to monitor temperature across town or around the world. Data can be exported to share with a healthcare professional or record in a spreadsheet.
Multiple user tracking: One app can manage multiple ActivAngel sensors and multiple users, storing weeks or months of user data. One family can share a single sensor, “linking” it to a person as needed. Or that same family can have multiple sensors, each of them “assigned” to an individual for easy monitoring.
Optional HealthKit connection, individual user can connect incoming data to own HealthKit.
Designed for iPhone.

The ActivAngel temperature sensor is accurate to ±0.1°C and is factory-calibrated for years of continuous temperature readings.
Bluetooth Low Energy: BLE technology connects quickly and easily to a smartphone, managing wireless transmission throughout a typical home with little drain on the ActivAngel or phone battery.
Small size (perfect for kids): The small ActivAngel temperature sensor is housed in a custom-designed, medical grade plastic case that is safe for children and sized for their smaller bodies.
Rechargeable battery: An integrated lithium polymer (LiPo) battery can be charged quickly for few minutes to get it work (fully about in 120 minutes) with the included micro USB cable, providing up to 7 days of continuous usage on a single charge.
Medical-grade adhesives: We use medical-grade adhesive similar to that found in high-quality bandages — safe for children and sensitive skin, whether worn for hours or days (3–5 days is the recommended limit before replacing).","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

If you would like to monitor your contractions during your pregnancy in order not to be looking on the timer, waiting with paper and pen, this is your contraction timer app.

How does the contraction timer work?
You probably have questions like:
What is a contraction? What do contractions feel like? How long do contractions last? What are the symptoms of labor contractions? How do I know that I have pregnancy contractions?
Apart from counting contraction and intervals, we will help you to know more about pregnancy, contraction pains and everything you should know about this topic.
It is very easy to use:
1.- Once you have downloaded the app, you will see that there are various options in the main menu: the contraction counter, the contraction tracker and tips.
2.- Contraction counter: This is the main tool of one of the best pregnancy apps. Therewith, you can count and register your contractions. Based on the contractions and their intervals the app detects, it can inform you when you should go to hospital for delivery. Whether you have contractions every 10 minutes, every 5 minutes, etc., it is important to write them down.
3.- Contraction tracker: Here you will find a summary of everything you have registered so that you can keep track of all your contractions. You might have contractions without pain during your pregnancy (or even false contractions) you don't notice, but don't worry, the important ones will be those in the final stage of pregnancy.
3.- Tips and tricks: Here you will find some articles we have prepared to help you at this stage of pregnancy. Different types of labour pain symptoms, how to identify them, how to time contractions, stages of pregnancy, etc.

Main characteristics of the app contraction timer:
* Contraction tracker, contraction counter and tips: An all-in-one app to help you in the final stage of your pregnancy.
* No matter if you have uterine contractions or braxton hicks contractions, this pregnancy tracker app will be very helpful to count and monitor them. 
* This app is not a pregnancy calendar or pregnancy calculator. Its purpose is to help you count the kicks during all stages of labor.

Informative note: This contraction app is an informative app and it should not be considered as 100 % true under no circumstances, due to the fact that it is based on estimations and is no medical or scientific test.","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

We offer post abortion peer counseling and bibical foundation study and prayer counseling for experincing healing for the wounded spirit.","iPhone3GS-iPhone-3GS,iPhone4-iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen-iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

Calendar for 2nd semester of 2018 (July to December 2018).

It’s a simple and natural method, which has been used successfully by ancient civilizations like the Chaldeans and it’s based on the astrological movements of the moon. According to this method, the Moon has a great influence on the acidity level of the vaginal fluid. On the other hand, scientific studies have indicated that the acidity of the vaginal fluid determines which of the two types of chromosomes (i.e. the X female or Y male chromosome) reaches its objective. This App indicates which days the Moon influences to have a boy or a girl.

It includes a beautiful and colorfull Calendar with pink days (days where you would conceive a girl) and blue days (days where you would conceive a boy).

Even if you check your calendar, chances are you might still miss that day where you have increased probability to conceive that girl or that boy you always wanted. Don’t worry! This App will send you notifications and alerts to remind you the day when you should have intercourse with your partner to get pregnant with a boy or a girl depending on your preferences.

Start Smart for Your Baby by Louisiana Healthcare Connections helps you connect to Louisiana Healthcare Connections staff and resources, create your pregnancy action plan, track your pregnancy milestones, look up your and symptoms and issues, so you can have a healthier pregnancy.

And there is more...The big day is coming! So many things are changing and there’s much to learn. For one, how can you best manage that “morning” sickness that seems to show up any time of day? When will your baby have a heartbeat? And what do your ultrasounds mean? 

Begin by using Start Smart for Your Baby to make a healthy pregnancy action plan. Just enter your due date and birth date, and Start Smart begins personalizing your pregnancy milestones. After answering questions about how you're doing, you’ll learn about health issues related to your own pregnancy. 

You can also use Start Smart to look up any symptoms you’re having, see weekly ultrasound videos of how your baby is growing, and track your weight gain. Can’t seem to remember to make that appointment or drink enough water each day? 

You can even set reminders so you won't forget the important things to do when you’re pregnant.

Along the way, make a list of things to talk about with your doctor. When you see something you want to talk about to your doctor, midwife, or nurse, you can add it to your Hot List to easily remember at your next appointment.

Start Smart is developed in conjunction with a board certified OB who has over 15 years' experience taking care of women and their babies. Other contributors include nurses, midwives and other medical experts.

Visit Louisiana Healthcare Connections to learn more about the resources and services they provide to help take care of you and your baby.

Use the app in your center, take it on the go, or hand it to a client for intake wherever you meet her.

The Next Level app allows you to toggle between client and staff modes on a mobile device, so you can securely enter and update any client’s information while she’s still sitting knee-to- knee with you.

Plus, the Next Level app allows you to look up any donor’s information on the go, allowing you to make the most of divine appointments at a banquet, church parking lot or grocery store.

Designed by a team of professional healthcare software developers, Next Level closes the loop from receptionist to client, to advocate and nurse—all in real time.

Whether you’re meeting a client in your office, a church parking lot or on the go, your data is always secure and available at the tap of a finger.

Next Level also harnesses the power of big data, leveraging local and national trends to help you make the best decisions you can for the women you serve every day.

Incorporating the necessary HIPAA protections, Next Level is powered by Heartbeat International and crafted to manage pregnancy help efforts of all stripes—medical, resource, linear, mobile units, and more!

We start with your needs, envisioning the client you serve and wondering, “How can we make sure she never falls through the cracks?” And, we start with your center, “How can we save your center time, money and help you reach more women?”

While we’re pushing toward these two goals, we’ve got a larger mission in mind: “How can we make the life-affirming pregnancy help movement stronger?”

We believe it’s time to make a change. It’s time to take our movement—and your ministry’s client management—to the Next Level.","iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

Pranayama aide with timing choice - Nice! (Jul 18, 2012) posted by Jonny0007
UPGRADED to 5 Stars! The developer added the guidance of sound-tones which was the only feature this app lacked (now you can close your eyes while you breath, if you wish). In my opinion, this breathing app is the BEST one out there IF: you want total control of the breath timing, you don't need instruction, and you don't want a lot of ""bells and whistles"" on your app. The app is simply designed and the visuals & audio foster relaxation nicely. Big thanks to the developers for the update!

Beautiful (Jun 29, 2012)  posted by Oinjjko
You could pay a lot for a breathing app and not get half of what this app gives you. Beautiful to view while you use breathing patterns you have total control over. Thank you for wonderful breathing app. Also the big timer in front of you is another beautiful feature. The timer can be displayed while doing breathing exercises or taken off the screen. The bubble audio is so relaxing, another wonderful feature.

OVUSENSE - THE MOST ACCURATE CYCLE MONITORING SYSTEM YOU CAN BUY: 
- Clinically proven in over 6,000 cycles of use: Clinical studies show that ovulation predictor kits (OPKs), and fertility tracker Apps can produce an incorrect result in at least one in every five cycles1, leaving you confused about when to try to get pregnant. 
- Real time 24 hour advance ovulation prediction: Unlike any product, OvuSense provides a day's advance notice of when you are going to ovulate in real time along with your 4 day ovulation window – with clinically proven 96% correct results.[2]
- 8 day fertile window: In addition, at the start of each cycle OvuSense provides a full 8 day fertile window - these features help you take back control of your planning for pregnancy.[2]
- 99% accurate patented technology: Protected by nine patents, OvuSense monitors your 'core temperature' while you sleep, giving a true indication of your Progesterone levels each cycle enabling the detection of the exact date of ovulation with 99% accuracy proven in clinical trials.[2] 
- Fully certified: OvuSense is a fully regulated medical device and complies with all the necessary certifications for the countries in which it is available – MDD CE mark in Europe, FDA 510(k) in USA, CMDCAS in Canada, TGA in Australia.

THE OVUSENSE SYSTEM:
- OvuSense has two parts: a vaginal Sensor and an App. 
- You will require an OvuSense Sensor to measure your cycles. 
- The App charts and messages provide all the information you need to help you identify when you ovulate, giving you the best chances of conceiving.
- You can use the OvuSense App to share data with your doctor and family members.

TRUSTED BY WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN LET DOWN BY OTHER PRODUCTS:

“I want to express how horrible ovulation predictor kits are for women with PCOS. I never had a positive or even close to one in all the months I used them. OvuSense confirmed ovulation on Wednesday Feb. 24th 2016 and I’m now pregnant! This OvuSense machine is amazing!! If you are considering buying…do it. So worth the money.” Eden Nicole, 2016

“I am pregnant after using OvuSense for two months. We were trying for 8+ years before that.” Kirsty, 2015

“OvuSense confirmed my exact ovulation date. I was amazed how late it was in my cycle! I had no idea how late I ovulated and I would have never guessed on my own. I knew that I might not ovulate every month, but at least I knew that I had this month. I never would have of have known that, or ‘when’ it was, if I didn't have OvuSense!” Jenny, 2015","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

- Consultations with the midwife or gynecologist
- Echographies
- Diabetes and Down syndrome screenings

With this pregnancy wheel, you can also compute the Body Mass Index (BMI) of your patient in order to prevent for excessive or insufficient weight gain during the pregnancy.

Pranayama aide with timing choice - Nice! (Jul 18, 2012) posted by Jonny0007
UPGRADED to 5 Stars! The developer added the guidance of sound-tones which was the only feature this app lacked (now you can close your eyes while you breath, if you wish). In my opinion, this breathing app is the BEST one out there IF: you want total control of the breath timing, you don't need instruction, and you don't want a lot of ""bells and whistles"" on your app. The app is simply designed and the visuals & audio foster relaxation nicely. Big thanks to the developers for the update!

Beautiful (Jun 29, 2012)  posted by Oinjjko
You could pay a lot for a breathing app and not get half of what this app gives you. Beautiful to view while you use breathing patterns you have total control over. Thank you for wonderful breathing app. Also the big timer in front of you is another beautiful feature. The timer can be displayed while doing breathing exercises or taken off the screen. The bubble audio is so relaxing, another wonderful feature. The developers got it right when they gave you total control of your breathing patterns, a lot of breathing apps don't give you this wonderful feature.

I feel grateful for these wonderful reviews. 


It has passed four years since the app was released. Version 5.0 is the first update in three years.

Now these new features are available.


Auto Stretch
You can find it in the timer setting view by pushing an clock shaped button which is located upper right.

Color Pick
Six pastel colors are set in the color buttons. But you can change the color as you like. Try long-press any color button to show a color picker.

Sound Only Mode
It was implemented in the old versions as Sleep Mode. You could breathe with sound navigation while you close your eyes, but needed to double-tap to add exhale time and single-tap to add inhale time. I loved to use the app with closed eyes, but it wasn’t comfortable. However you can use Auto stretch and Sound Only Mode at once now! Check off the box just below Auto Stretch setting pane.


I hope that you would love this version, too.


Thank you.","iPhone5-iPhone5,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

***Why download Music for Pregnancy?***

Classical music when played moderately has a calming effect rendering the heart to beat slower as well as the breathing to be deeper. This is because the music compels the brain to release endorphin which naturally relaxes the body.Thus, stress is reduced and mood is improved which are great for a baby’swell-being as well as for the caring parent. 

Babies start to hear at 6 months in the womb that is why mothers are encouraged to listen to classical music if at least just for its lasing effect for both baby and parent. Pregnancy is a special time but is riddled with stress and aiming for a calm disposition will likewise calm the baby inside. And because babies are likely to recognize the same music you played while he was still in the womb, the association will be comforting and provides baby with an extra sense of security.

Deficiency in women before or during pregnancy can cause brain and spinal cord birth defects in their children. Folate and vitamin B12 deficiency are also a cause of anemia. Additional app features include the at-a-glance descending order lists of folate and B12 content of >300 common foods in µg and %RDA (Adult Daily Recommended Dietary Allowance) /100g to help you plan folate- and vitamin B12-containing meals; and really useful hyperlinks to essential nutritional and healthy food information with ≈200 photos to support your weightloss, hearthealth or other diet. No internet connection, registration, personal details or additional payments required.
Folate  and vitamin B12 play key roles in DNA (genes) and red blood cell production. B12 deficiency damages the brain and nerves, and folate deficiency damages the skin and linings of the mouth and gut. B12 is not found in plantbased foods so vegans and vegetarians may become deficient if they don't take supplements. Alcoholics are prone to folate deficiency.

Health benefits of water?

Water is your body's principal chemical component and makes up about 60 percent of your body weight. Every system in your body depends on water. For example, water flushes toxins out of vital organs, carries nutrients to your cells, and provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues.

Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry out normal functions. Even mild dehydration can drain your energy and make you tired.

How much water do you need?

Every day you lose water through your breath, perspiration, urine and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you must replenish its water supply by consuming beverages and foods that contain water.

So how much fluid does the average, healthy adult living in a temperate climate need? The Institute of Medicine determined that an adequate intake (AI) for men is roughly about 13 cups (3 liters) of total beverages a day. The AI for women is about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of total beverages a day.

Pranayama aide with timing choice - Nice! (Jul 18, 2012) posted by Jonny0007
UPGRADED to 5 Stars! The developer added the guidance of sound-tones which was the only feature this app lacked (now you can close your eyes while you breath, if you wish). In my opinion, this breathing app is the BEST one out there IF: you want total control of the breath timing, you don't need instruction, and you don't want a lot of ""bells and whistles"" on your app. The app is simply designed and the visuals & audio foster relaxation nicely. Big thanks to the developers for the update!

Beautiful (Jun 29, 2012)  posted by Oinjjko
You could pay a lot for a breathing app and not get half of what this app gives you. Beautiful to view while you use breathing patterns you have total control over. Thank you for wonderful breathing app. Also the big timer in front of you is another beautiful feature. The timer can be displayed while doing breathing exercises or taken off the screen. The bubble audio is so relaxing, another wonderful feature.

Prenatal yoga sounds like a healthy practice to adopt during pregnancy -- and it is. But what specifically can yoga do to help you feel great and stay calm during the most important nine months of your life? Read on for seven important ways yoga can make a positive difference in your pregnancy.

Prenatal yoga classes are very popular, and when paired with a cardiovascular exercise (such as walking), yoga can be an ideal way for moms-to-be to stay in shape. Whether you're a newbie or a veteran, yoga can keep you limber, tone your muscles, and improve your balance and circulation during pregnancy – all with very little impact on your joints.

Yoga is also beneficial because you'll learn how to breathe deeply and consciously relax, which will be helpful as you face the physical demands of labor, birth, and new motherhood. Learning to breathe fully is actually one of the first things you'll learn in a yoga class. To use the breathing technique practiced in yoga, known as ujjayi, you take in air slowly through your nose, fill your lungs as you expand your belly, and exhale completely until your stomach compresses.

Can prenatal yoga be the first time I ever do yoga?
Yes! You don’t have to be a yogi before you conceive to jump on the prenatal yoga bandwagon. As long as your doctor has given you the green light to stay physically active during pregnancy, yoga is an ideal activity for all expectant moms: It’s gentle and designed for pregnancy, which means it helps prepare you for the mental aspects of childbirth (and beyond). But remember, it’s always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting any new exercise during pregnancy.","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

Why is it important for me to have an ultrasound?

Even if you are thinking of having an abortion, an ultrasound is important. It can help you determine if the procedure is really necessary or not. Some women find that they are having a miscarriage and do not need an abortion, have a pregnancy outside of the uterus and need prompt medical intervention, or are unsure of how far along they are. For your health and safety, we recommend it, and it's FREE!

Because when a person has hope, anything is possible. But when hope is crushed, dreams begin to fade, and options seem limited.

We’ve experienced those times in our lives; times when we let the circumstances of life rob us of hope and joy. Through those tough times we’ve also discovered that no matter how hard and how painful life seems, hope is still there, waiting for us to choose it.

We have the opportunity each day to meet with some of our confused, hurting neighbors who make the brave decision to come to LivingWell for help. Some are facing an unexpected pregnancy, a struggle with a past pregnancy decision, or a sexual health issue. Sometimes, we meet an expecting mom or dad who is feeling overwhelmed and underprepared at the thought of being a parent, or being a parent again. Whatever their story, we welcome them all with open arms.

Our promise is simple. We are a safe place: a place where someone will listen; a place to ask questions and get honest answers, a place where you can pause and explore your options; a place where someone will walk with you and help you discover hope in the unexpected.","iPhone3GS-iPhone-3GS,iPhone4-iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen-iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

Allowing for a better comprehension of complete human function, UmanMap allows us to assess an individual’s progress in acquiring competencies and self-knowledge within the family and wider society; it sets out a new way of approaching this complex area through thought, understanding and the actions to be taken.

UmanMap is split into 3 developmental phases:
- Infancy
- Childhood
- Preadolescence, adolescence and young adult

It is a scientific document based on the human sciences and validated by child-development specialists, child psychologists and educators.

What purpose does it serve?

It proposes educational and pedagogical objectives in a precise, logical and objective manner. Thanks to UmanMap, everybody can immerse themselves in the world of child and adolescent development, allowing them to anticipate and prevent potential problems and stimulate further development constructively and appropriately.

Technically, how does it work?


UmanMap is built along a horizontal axis of time, defined in months and years, and a vertical construction around the 5 fundamental elements of human development essential to an individual’s acquisition of independence and autonomy, namely:

- Social and emotional development
- Cognitive (intellectual) development
- Linguistic development
- Motor development
- Somatic development

The boxes then placed on the chart are the essential elements of development; once acquired by an individual, they will endure for the rest of their lives. More complex elements are explained and defined in more detail in such a way as to be accessible for all. 

Educational themes are elaborated upon by UmanMap in a more complete way in order to allow adults to deepen their understanding, while the “Historical” tool allows them to create a synthesis of any child or adolescent’s progress in real-time.  

Who is it for?

UmanMap is a working tool for professionals in the health and social care fields, but is equally useful for parents who want to better understand and help their child’s development.

It allows an adult, whether parent, educator, therapist or doctor, to know where a child is within their individual development, to guide them, and do so without losing themselves or the child in the process.","iPhone4-iPhone4,iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

MEET Wildflower Health
Wildflower Health was born to help women make better healthcare decisions through the device that’s always at hand – their smartphone.
   “When I was pregnant in with my first child I recognized that what should be a time of joy was often tempered by uncertainty about health plan benefits, hospital services and appointment schedules. How could I help myself and my fellow moms better navigate this healthcare system for the entire family? I launched Wildflower Health and the Family Health mobile app to help the Chief Health Officer of the Home track family health with tools to navigate the growth of each family member.” – Leah Sparks, CEO & Founder

The Fertility Astrology app can tell anyone who wants to know what their ideal fertile times for conception will be in the year ahead – within minutes.

Timing is everything. Astrology and conception are all about cycles and timing.

Many couples struggling with infertility will have to make a decision about when to have treatment, whether or not that treatment is IVF, Artificial Insemination, or a home plan. Time needs to be taken off work and plans need to be shifted.  Very often a large part of the stress involved is who decides when to cycle.  This app hopes to make this decision really easy by giving couples the next three best potentially lucky times in which to try to conceive.  Couples will enter their birth time, date and place into the app, fill out a short medical questionnaire and within minutes the app will give a page of results of the these times, listed in chronological order.  The app will take both charts into consideration and the results will be a combination of the birth data entered. The medical questionnaire will prompt any necessary medical considerations, tests and treatments that might need to take place before conception can be attempted.

Main App Features
•	Caters to different family variations
•	Offers an appropriate medical questionnaire
•	Prompts necessary medical and lifestyle intervention
•	Saves at the exact place in the sequence for quick access on return
•	Computes three potential conception times for the year ahead
•	Suitable for both natural and medically-assisted conception
•	Makes us of Fertility Astrology’s unique astrological calculations.

SOME FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - ANSWERED

Who is the “gestational carrier?”
A gestational carrier is the person who intends carrying and giving birth to the baby. So, if you are in a heterosexual relationship, then the female who intends to give birth is the gestational carrier…in a male same sex couple, this person would be the surrogate. If you are a trans couple, whichever one of you is going to be physically carrying the baby and giving birth is the gestational carrier. The partner of the gestational carrier is the person who is in a co-parenting relationship with the carrier, not the sperm donor.

What happens if I don’t know my exact birth time?
The best results are achieved when you enter an accurate birth time. However, a lot of people are not exactly sure of when they are born therefore our suggestion is to enter the time you think were born to the nearest 10-15mins. Some people think they were born between certain time frames - for example 10 and 10.30 - in which case please enter 10.15.  If you have absolutely no idea, then this app is unable to predict reliable times for you. Should you still wish to consult with Nicola please contact her via fertilityastrology.com

What if the atlas does not list the place where I was born?
You will be prompted to enter the nearest available city on the atlas, north or south of the location where you were born.  

Will these results change over time?
No, these results are unlikely to change, unless of course your birth data was incorrect and you now have new information, in which case you will have to re-purchase.

What if I don’t have the information required to fill out the medical questionnaire?
You can always stop and save your information and return later with your test results or additional medical updates. Entering your correct data enables us to optimise the app to give you the most accurate results based on the information you enter.

Birth Positions - an active choice is you and your partners guide to an active birth.
The app is developed by experienced midwives, and it will help you to use your body optimally during labour and birth.
The app contains video of how many different labour- and birth positions you can choose at home and in the delivery room.
Each video is available in two versions: One for you, and one for your partner.

Why is it important to know about birth positions?
Movement, change of positions and resting will affect both the perception of pain, and the duration of labour.
You should be aware of the possibillities, and know what advantages and disadvantages there is to the different positions.
Use the app for your birth preparation, and discuss birth positions with your partner and your birth professionals.

Labour positions are used in the first phase of birth.
At this time, it is important that you relax and rest well in between contractions, in order to save your strength for later.
Movement and relaxation will help your body to make room for the baby, and can relieve pain.

Birth positions are used in the active phase.
When pushing, you need positions where you can work actively with your contractions.
Movement will help your pelvis to widen, so your baby can move through the birth canal.

Both labour and birth positions can affect the intensity and effect of your labour.
Different positions will make for more or less contact with your partner or midwife, and your possibilities of moving, resting and relaxing.
We’ll guide you through the different positions, and tell your partner what he can do to support you.

Birth is movement, and birth is hard labour.
While pregnant, you can prepare for birth through exercise.
It is also important to remember to eat and drink during labour, both for you, and for your partner who’ll be supporting you physically and mentally, and will tend to forget himself.

Functions:
-  Video demonstrations of labour positions
-  Video demonstrations of birth positions
-  My downloads: Your downloaded files, which are now available for viewing off-line

Users provide the abdominal circumference (AC) as well as one or more of the following: biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL) and head circumference (HC). The app then uses one of the standard fetal weight estimation algorithms (Shepard or Hadlock) to provide the estimate.

It is the replacement for the daily sheet with the ability to add notes, photos, videos, memos and so much more!

NannyNotes is the daily sheet replacement that keeps parents informed about their children while away at work or traveling. With an intuitive and easy to use baby tracker, caregivers can quickly log sleep schedules, diapers, feedings and activities with notes, photos and videos that are immediately available for parents. Don’t miss out on your child’s day while you are away. Use NannyNotes and stay connected no matter where you are!

""As a first time mom it was hard going back to work after having our son. With NannyNotes I am able to constantly check during the day and see what my little man is doing"" - Amy

What does a day with NannyNotes look like?
Parents can start the day by adding a memo or two for the caregiver. A memo notification will appear and contain a reminder such as laundry or going to a swim lesson. Parents can also add a note just like a caregiver about when the child wakes up, their diaper and and what they ate for breakfast. This information will all be available for the caregiver when they start their day. 

Child wakes up early? Now the caregiver is aware and perhaps the nap might be a bit early that day. 

Throughout the day the caregiver logs notes such as sleep schedules, snacks, diapers and activities. Throughout the day parents can see the activity in real time on their device. When the parent comes home this information is all accessible to them. 

Did the child skip their nap?- Perhaps bed time should be earlier? Was lunch later than normal? Perhaps dinner should be later that night.

NannyNotes is the app that will keep everyone connected and in sync with their child’s day!

""I often travel for work which can put me in different timezones. NannyNotes allows me to see what my daughter is doing with our Nanny at any time."" - Nate

Our app has been developed alongside leading clinicians and healthcare professionals to ensure it’s a top service for new parents like you. 

We’re incredibly excited to be on this parenting journey with you. Together, we can normalise Maternal Mental Health and #MakeItMainstream.

Here’s what the app can do for you, and a quick how-to-use-it guide. 

What The Moment App Does:
The Moment Health app is for new and expectant mums and their families. 

Our app is committed to making maternal mental health mainstream. Research shows that through early intervention, parents suffering perinatal depression and associated anxieties have an 80-90 per cent chance of recovery.

That’s exactly why we’re harnessing the positive power of technology with an app that screens for prenatal and postnatal depression and associated anxieties, through the following innovative features:

CHECKER 
Our early intervention symptoms checker can be used to detect signs of prenatal and postnatal depression and associated anxieties.

It’s an easy-to-use, evidence-based series of quick questions, used by GPs, clinicians and other healthcare providers the world over to screen for early signs of  prenatal and postnatal depression and associated anxieties.

TRACKER 
The tracker allows you to quickly record your emotions and moods from pregnancy right through to early parenthood. 

It provides a Weekly Mood Report, which shows at a glance how you’ve been feeling over the last days, weeks and months. 

With the Tracker, any emotional changes that could potentially lead to a negative impact on your wellbeing can be picked up and treated very early on. 

COMMUNITY 
The Moment Health community is made up of likeminded parents like you. 

The four major focuses for the community are to provide (1) Connectedness, (2) Support, (3) Companionship, and (4) Advice for our members.

Our community provides a space for our members to share openly and react with empathy in a safe and supportive environment.

LOCATOR 
Through our location tool, mums and dads can find exactly the kind of support and resources they need that are close and convenient to them. 

The location tool recommends centres and groups in close proximity to you, based on where you are and what kind of support you need.

It separates itself compared to similar Apps based on the fact that I've developed this App just before my own baby was born and optimized it afterwards! Using my own experience I knew exactly what you need to ideally time contractions!

Timing a contraction is easy, press start when it starts and press stop when it ends! From experience I've learned that you easily forget to press stop with everything that's going on. That's why this App lets you hear a small beep at 60- and 90- seconds! When you press stop it automatically saves the start/stop time and calculates the two most important things: the duration of the contraction and the time that has passed since the last contraction!

In the 2nd tab you will find a nice summary of all timed contractions where you can instantly see if you can call your midwife already. You can even e-mail this overview to your midwife or perhaps after giving birth to yourself if you'd like!

Classical music is structured much differently from other types of music and is considered more complex. And it is this complexity that proves beneficial as it stimulates the pathways in the brain that works out-spatial reasoning. Spatial-temporal reasoning is the ability to envision and rotate images in the mind in time and space. This is a crucial skill in learning maths and science and is best demonstrated in the game of chess when you need to think ahead and envision what will happen next.

It is the only obstetrical wheel that allows for defining your own date or date range (e.g., LMP+3Weeks+2days, or Conception + 20weeks). A special interface dedicated to an easy definition of dates allows for daily and intensive use. The key data to be defined or calculated are:
•The last menstrual period,
•The conception date,
•The due date,
•The embryo length at a given date,
•The gestational age at a given date.
The embryo length or the gestational age could therefore be defined by using previous ultrasound measure. 

At any time a set of consistent data (dates, gestational age or embryo length) is proposed, the reference data being outlined with a blue star.

A large calendar allows for a global view of all user-defined dates.

ObstetriCalc is highly adaptable through the definition of additional dates (or date range) that are defined by adding days or weeks to one of the previous reference date (LMP, due date, conception date).","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

There is no need to track temperature or to analyze secretions any further!

And how to survive the mine field of challenges we face when raising our children from birth to the teenage years in the fast paced 21st century. Parents often feel isolated so Well Fed Kids – Talking All Things Parenting, is a much-needed resource for parents.
Well Fed Kids in its easy to use format, explores an array of topics, interviews and research drawing on the experience and wisdom of other parents and professionals. It combines strategies and practical tools for parents to gain knowledge and form their own solutions for their individual family. The modern family looks very different today so we’re bringing everyone in on the conversation, same sex couples, single parents, second time-round parents.

No topic is taboo! You’ll find Interviews, blogs, podcasts, recipes, videos, developmental charts and food charts.

Example topics include Mindful Attention, Active Listening and Separating Behaviour from Self Worth. Your child’s diet has a huge effect on their behaviour and growth so topics from “Talking all Things Poo” (and why digestive health is important), “Foods to Nourish the Brain”, “Cooking with Kids”, “Understanding Sugar”, “Homemade Fast Food” provide tangible real life advice.
Why we made this App! Babies are not born with an instruction manual or rulebook and there’s no one size fits all approach. The landscape for kids today is very different than it was in previous generations and we live in a complicated, fast changing world. As parents, we know our children the best but often we feel stuck, not knowing how to move forward or what to do next. The Well Fed Kids App will inspire and guide you with its useful content and strategies.

Research shows there’s far too much judgment within the parenting arena and that’s without the weight of our own personal, self-inflicted guilt. There are very few resources available to support, connect and empower parents. This app is a one-stop shop to share the load and find those tips to create a happy, healthy and progressive family life.

Families face a lot of challenges: divorce, an absent parent, business, financial pressures, lack of communication, negative media influences, materialism and that’s the tip of the ice-berg. Each of these factors takes a toll, research suggests that: 
• Approximately half of today’s two-parent families, both now work full time and feel that both their work and home life suffer. They also report finding parenting tiring and stressful, rather than enjoyable and rewarding. (Pew Research Center Nov.2015)
• Depression affects 10% of the adult population. (CDC)
• For every 2.4 marriages in 2011, there was one divorce. (U.S. Census Department)

It uses the date of Last Menstrual Period (LMP) to calculate Estimated Due Date (EDD) and Gestational Age (GA). No more imprecise paper wheels - this tool is always at hand, in your pocket!

We've separated the outer and inner wheels to make this easy-to-use. Spin the green wheel to set the LMP date. Spin the purple wheel to browse important milestones, and to calculate the gestational age on a specific date (displayed in the middle).

Prefer to enter dates manually? No problem. Select ""Set"" and choose dates by LMP, EDD, or GA on a specific date. Use the ""Info"" screen to see important dates (trimesters, testing and windows) and information on fetal biometry reference ranges (Lessoway) based on current gestational age.

Need to calculate the EDD from a dating ultrasound report? Rotate the purple wheel until the GA shown matches the GA on the ultrasound report. Then, rotate the green wheel until the date matches the date of the ultrasound. The EDD will be displayed below. Alternatively, input the GA and ultrasound date manually in the ""Set"" screen.

Pregnancy means that you are up for a big transition in your life. Not only practical changes will occur, you will also go through emotional changes. Major life transitions, such as pregnancy, are important and require attention and a good preparation. 

Most programs that aim to prepare expecting couples for parenthood, concentrate on physical aspects of pregnancy, labour and baby care. Physical health is obviously very important and should be rewarded with your attention. There is however another type of health that is equally important: emotional health. 

Parents2b focuses on the emotional health of you, your partner and your baby. Emotional health is about being happy, resilient, self-confident and self-aware.

Many new parents have to get used to parenthood. Scientific evidence shows that a good preparation can help you to ease the transition, resulting in a good start for your new family. 

The information in this app is based on scientific insights.

The full program gives you more important themes to think about and discuss with your partner, more useful video clips and more exercises to connect to your baby. It will give you all the information you need to make sure that you, your partner and your baby will make a good transition to this new life. You can follow this program whenever the timing is right for you. Following the entire program will take up approximately 10 minutes of your time every week.

Please make sure to always contact your health care provider immediately if something seems wrong!

You can just use it to track your monthly cycles and your mood. 
Or you use it to help you along your pregnancy when you have to count the kicks of your baby.
Maybe you want to find out at what times your new baby typically naps, eventually these times will be your sleeping times too.
Or - as it's always the question among nursing mothers - which side is next... and of course a simple yet pretty emergency game for your infant or toddler when you need both hands for something else for a minute.

We, being parents ourself, don't know what features appeal most to you personally, but we know which features appeal to most want-to-be, soon-to-be or are-already parents.

Aloha Baby App provides you with a lot of functionality, but we made sure everything is accessible instead of overwhelming.

Now, here's much but not all of what Aloha Baby App can keep for you:

* Female Monthly Cycle / Period tracking 
* Mood - yours, the baby, anyone you know...
* A simple Diet Plan
* Allergies
* Vaccinations
* Medications
* Dental Development
* Dental Care & Dental Issues
* Ultrasound results
* Fetal movements
* Contractions
* All things Baby - Diapers, Bottle Feedings, Solid Feedings, Temperature, Development Milestones... and much more if you like.
* Nursing - which side, when, how often, how long... Also supports Twin Feedings!
* Breastmilk extraction - also keeps record how much you've already used
* Info Graphics for many data points when numbers just won't do
* Seamless conversion between imperial and metric customary units
* Custom formatting options

We also keep a keen eye on what Aloha Baby App cannot do yet or not good enough.

We're also working hard to incorporate a good synching solution, statistics which explain more by showing less and a better way for you to set and keep track of reminders.

At any time you can see what we are working on by looking at our public project management on Trello - you find the link at the bottom of each screen in Aloha Baby App. We want to give you the best possible transparency.

Aloha Baby App does not track you, read your data, access your images, your contacts, your calendar or your microphone unless it has to and when you want it to (after all you can't save an image without providing access to your photo library). We are ad supported, but if you like the app you can make a small purchase to support us to remove the advertising. This will help us greatly, but you are free to pass - you are getting the full  platinum unlocked version, no silly purchase to save a diaper, add another baby or view your statistics.

We use optional in app analytics for the sole purpose of learning how the app is getting used, what is not getting used and if so - why it crashes. Not to identify you, to track you or to read your data.

There are experts who believe that listening to classical can make a baby healthier, smarter, and happier.
The idea that classic music can help babies is nothing new, but in recent decades, a great deal of evidence supporting the notion has been accumulated. Intriguingly, there is now quite a bit of data that indicates classic tunes can enhance a baby’s physical development and health in addition to intelligence.

Why Should I Choose Classical Music for My Babies?

1. Positive on Physical Health
2. Good for Language Development
3. Able to Uplift Their Mood

Some Criteria You Should Know
There are many different kinds of classical music out there, some of which are not appropriate for children. Wagnerian opera, for example, is probably too loud and violent for children. Parents should be careful because some classical compositions could overstimulate or bore children.
Experts like those at the American Music Therapy Association have compiled a list of attributes that classical songs for children should possess. These characteristics include:
A steady beat. Songs with a lot of vocals will not help babies because they lack a beat.
A steady and regular rhythm. Music without a steady rhythm can stimulate children, but it will not relax them nor will it encourage the development of memory skills.
The song should be fairly simple and easy to understand. Orchestral works and operas are often simply too complex for young children to grasp. In particular, look for works with no vocals that utilize only one or two instruments.

Selecting today’s pill a third time will return the pill back to the original “not taken” setting in case you had not taken it. To help avoid any mistakes you will only be able to change your pill status for your current day and past days. The pills for the next day onwards will be disabled.

Virtual blister strips begin with the word “Start” and contain arrows to guide you to the next day.

A reminder is displayed to count down till your next pill. If you’ve missed taking the pill at the set time then the timer changes to indicate the time the pill is overdue by.

Below that is an approximate count of how many days remain till the start of your menstrual cycle. This is not shown if you have selected Azalia®. Some women may not start bleeding on the first day but within the 7 day break from the pill. If you experience bleeding outside of the 7 days while taking the pill then you may want to consult your GP. For Azalia® when a strip is empty, you must start with a new pack the next day – without interruption and without waiting for bleeding.

When you go on holiday to a destination in a different time zone it is important to continue to take your pills at 24 hour intervals. This app will keep that 24 hour timing as long as your phone remains set to Irish time, which may be different to the local time at your holiday destination. For example, if the app is set to remind you daily at 10am Irish Summer Time (i.e. 09:00 GMT) and you travel to Melbourne then you will be reminded to take your next pill at 19:00 local Melbourne time. If you change your app reminder settings to the local time at your destination, then you will need to calculate the difference in hours to make sure your pills are taken at the correct time. It is your responsibility to make sure your pills are being taken correctly.

You will also be notified with a pop-up message if you’ve not visited the app for more than one day. You can then choose to mark all these previous days with missed or taken pills. These can be adjusted afterwards manually by selecting the pills taken to correct the display and your history records.

Baby sleep problems do not discriminate so making an affordable and widely available product for parents was the reason behind this App.

Our aim was to make this as easy to use as possible and give answers not just tips or suggestions on what to do to solve the problem. Exhausted, sleep deprived parents are desperate for answers and will try just about anything however good old Dr Google can swamp them with too much information leaving them confused and not sure where to begin.

In total, the APP features this valuable information (and more)::
*correct room temperature
*correct bedding
*the importance of white noise 
*how to spot tired signs
*detailed daily routines for all ages and sleep requirements
*extensive troubleshooting on nighttime waking problems and how to solve them
*how to communicate with your baby
*how much sleep a baby needs
*how daytime naps affect nighttime sleep
*comforting products: what works
*what to do when out and about
*nutrition advice
*links to useful products for babies and parents

Once parents implement the advice in Baby Sleep Guide App they will be able to check in as often as needed when future sleep regressions arise or for growing routine information on when baby is ready to drop a nap. This App is ideal for parents with children aged between 0-36 months.

Baby Sleep Guide has transformed bedtime routines for thousands of parents around the globe!

Make a birth plan that works for you—regardless of whether you plan to have your baby in hospital, in a birth center, at home, or by cesarean. Birth Plan Plus helps you create a clear and concise statement about your birth preferences. The birth of your baby should be one of the most memorable, life-changing, and joyful experiences of your life. It is important to spend some time thinking through what matters to you. What are your hopes and desires for birth? Birth Plan Plus guides you through a series of questions to help you with this process. We ask questions related to pregnancy, labor, delivery, and post postpartum care. We ask about what helps you feel comfortable. We cover tools for pain management, what you can do to help prepare for birth, postpartum tips, plus much more. 


MAINTAIN FOCUS ON WHAT YOU CAN CONTOL
A birth plan can help you maintain your focus. It helps you stay calm even if unexpected events occur. A birth plan helps us focus on what we can control. Of course, things may not go as planned and that is OKAY. Your healthcare team will use your birth plan to help guide and inform the process. Birth will unfold differently than you are envisioning. While, we can not control birth, we can control how we respond to the birthing process. Whatever works for you to birth your baby is exactly perfect for you and your child. 


INCLUDES PHOTOS OF YOUR SUPPORT TEAM
Easily add names and photos of the key members of your birthing support team and of yourself. This helps hospital staff quickly identity your birth team.


QUICKLY CREATE YOUR BIRTH PLAN
Once you go through our series of questions you choose to create and share your birth plan. You can save the plan directly to your phone as a PDF and/or share it with your partner, support team, and healthcare team. You will always have a digital version with you. We recommend to print a paper copy. The app will save your preferences but they are easy to edit if anything changes and you want to make a new plan. Click edit and go back though the questions and update your information and save your new birth plan. Ideally, you want to present your Birth Plan as one single sheet. IF your birth plan goes to two pages please consider limiting some of your preferences. 


SHARE AND DISCUSS
Your birth plan is a great tool for guiding discussions about birth with your healthcare and support team. This makes sure everyone is on the same page, and that your wishes are known well before the birthing process starts. These discussions will give you confidence and build trust with your birth team. Your health care professionals will use your birth plan as a guide for any decisions that need to be made along the way. 


BIRTH AND PREGNANCY RESOURCES 
Our network of Mamas, with a variety of birthing experiences, have compiled our favorite tips. Birth Plan Plus includes lists of essential items to take to the hospital, highly recommended books, baby products, and tips for postpartum care. you'll find helful lists for having a home birth and what you’ll need if you are considering a home water birth.

CONGRATULATIONS!

Connecting To Baby 

This is a short relaxation allowing you the time to connect with your baby.  Taking a few minutes with your baby can be beneficial for you both.

Breathing through a contraction

Breathing through a contraction demonstrates the breathing technique that we learn in class.  This breath has been very successful for lots of the ladies who come to the classes.  They say it is really does help them focus on the breath and remain calm through each contraction.  The chapter also shows a sighing breath, which is fabulous to release any tension that may have been acquired during the contraction.  


Cloud relaxation

This relaxation helps you relax your whole body and then encourages you to imagine you are lying on a cloud and floating through the air.  Floating is very relaxing and whilst your mind is floating, it means it is not so easy for adrenaline to come into your body.  Enjoy.

Laughter

When all else fails, it is a good idea to simply laugh. Laughing releases tension and therefore is really beneficial.  This clip was left in the Preparing for Birth app because laughing is so good for you, and for that reason I decided to keep it in the app and share it again on this app.  I hope you enjoy it.

Breathing through a contraction 

Explains in more detail how using the breath can make it easier for you to cope with your contractions 

Quote from Jenni who attended my classes and gave birth to a beautiful baby boy:

“All I can say is that if you could bottle that shooing breath and sell it, you'd be a millionaire!!! I wish you could have seen just how well it worked!”



Mantras: 

This is a list of examples of positive statements.   You can use any of these or you can choose one of your own. Using mantras can be very beneficial.

Tips for Birth:

In class we substitute the word labour for the word journey.  We picture our labour as a journey and at the end of the journey you are meeting and holding your baby in your arms.

Two useful products in one for your pregnancy!

Congratulations on your pregnancy, we wish you all the best!

This application provides several simple to use tools, all designed as aids for certain key points as your pregnancy progresses.  Our focus was to make the tools as simple and easy to use as possible, knowing that the times when you use them will involve distractions and quite possibly painful episodes too.

* Fetal (foetal) Kick/Movement Counter.  
Use on a daily (or as frequently as you like!) basis to monitor your baby's kicks and movements.  Your doctor knows best for your specific condition, but as a rule of thumb you should be able to discern 10 noticeable movements within a 2 hour window.  This tool will allow you simply to keep track over those movements to help you ensure all is well.   You can browse out to check your email, or change your music playlist while you monitor, and the counter will keep track right where you left off.

* Contraction Interval/Duration Timer.  
With just a single button tap required to indicate the start and end of your contractions you will be able to track your progression towards 'true labor' without having to cope with complicated functions as you are most likely distracted by more important pains and feelings.  

Again, your doctors know best for you, but the well known 5-1-1 rule (contractions occurring 5 minutes apart for a sustained duration of 1 minute for an hour) is the kind of contraction monitoring you will most likely be asked to perform.   In addition to tracking both the intervals between, and durations of contractions, this tool will also allow you tor track the intensity of the contractions too.  Simple counters display all the figures you need, and include session averages as well as a graphical representation of whether or not you are trending nearer to your goal or not.

*Contraction Log
See all the data you've recorded for each session in a single dedicated screen, graphically representing times, trends and intensities for each contraction and interval.

* Hospital 'To Do' Checklists.
Save having to worry about those little things you may forget when the time comes to make your way to the delivery ward.  Our quick checklists list the most useful items to take to make the whole delivery process as smooth as possible.  Separate sections show individual lists for the mum to be, her partner, the baby, and any siblings who are about to get a new brother or sister too.


A bit of background:
The member of our team who wrote this application, was doing so primarily for his wife.  She is currently entering her second trimester, and they are expecting their second child.  They are excited about the coming months, and being able to use this tool for themselves too!  This time she won't need to be scribbling on bits of paper to keep count, like she did last time around!

A quick look forward:
We will continue to actively develop this application, and already have plans in motion for several exciting additions to the tool in upcoming releases.  In the meantime, we encourage your feedback on any features you would like to see us add (or change) for future versions that would make it even more useful and simple to use.","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

It refers to the time when a woman stops ovulating. Once this happens she ceases to have her period anymore.

In most women this natural occurrence happens between age 47 and 53.

This physical disruption is very distressing for most women. Some females going through menopause only have mild symptoms but others are simply overwhelmed by anxiety, pain and mood swings. Just getting through the menopausal phase of life can feel like an uphill battle that must be fought every day.

As a woman who has been through menopause I have to tell you that I feel it is one of the most misunderstood conditions on earth. If you don't treat the symptoms you can make others absolutely miserable.

In Menopause Guide, You Will See:
- The prevalence of premature menopause (early menopause) in this society and why even women as young as twenty can experience it
- Climacteric periods which are the very last periods you have before your reproductive cycle is ended for good
- How the onset of menopause affects your hormones
- The symptoms of premenopause
- Why menopause just does not occur overnight
- The symptoms of perimenopause which indicates that the start of menopause is imminent sometime in the near future
- The difference between premenopause and perimenopause
- How to deal with the consequences of follicle stimulating hormones that take place during perimenopause
- The definition of postmenopause and how many months you should be without your period before your are defined as being in that state
- How to deal with the constant fluctuations in hormone levels
- Why you have less health risks once you enter postmenopause
- Why your symptoms of menopause are more difficult if you have had your ovaries removed

Hungry Baby eases the anxiety of caring for a crying infant by helping parents and caregivers to quickly identify their child’s cry of hunger and immediately respond to the infant’s needs.

To begin the translation, place the iPhone / iPod Touch near the crying baby. Aim the microphone to the baby and touch the “START” button. 

If the device is too far from the baby or there is significant background noise, a notice will appear asking you to begin the translation again.

The application also allows users to add contacts from their address book for fast and easy access in case of emergency.

But they should be. A stronger pelvic floor will help reduce your risk of incontinence, improve your sexual health, and boost your core strength and stability.

Pelvic Floor Exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, are essential to every woman’s exercise routine and they can be done anytime, anywhere, and without anyone noticing.

Pelvic floor muscle exercises can help:
- improve bladder and bowel control
- reduce the risk of prolapse
- improve recovery from childbirth and gynaecological surgery (in women)
- improve recovery after prostate surgery (in men)
- increase sexual sensation and orgasmic potential, and
- increase social confidence and quality of life.

Before starting a pelvic floor muscle training program it is important that you can identify your pelvic floor muscles correctly. Speak to a continence professional if you have difficulty identifying your pelvic floor muscles, are unsure if you are performing the exercises correctly or are continuing to experience bladder or bowel control symptoms.

It is best to have a continence professional assess your pelvic floor and develop an individualised pelvic floor muscle training program for you.","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

-----------------------
　機能の説明
-----------------------
■シンプルな入力画面
起動してすぐに基礎体温の入力ができます。
また生理が始まったときは生理ボタンを押すだけで、自動的に生理管理をしてくれます。
設定で体重・体脂肪率の記録もオンにすれば体重管理もできちゃいます。
またスタンプや自分で好きなだけ入力できるメモもついているので便利！


■便利なスタンプ
スタンプはワンタップで記録でき、グラフやカレンダーでも一目で確認できる便利な機能です。
合計18種類から好きなスタンプを使うことができます。
【スタンプ一覧】
なかよし、おりもの、出血、病院、時間ずれ、排卵、薬１、薬２、薬３、注射、風邪、ピル、体調不良、お通じ、お酒、夜ふかし、運動、スター


■カレンダー
記録した基礎体温が一目で確認でき、基準よりも体温が高かった日は色がつくので分かりやすいです。
また生理から何日目かも確認でき、生理予想日や排卵予想日もカレンダー上に表示されます。


■グラフ
記録した体温だけでなく、スタンプや生理、排卵予想日や次の生理予想も表示されます。
もちろん不要な項目は設定からオフにできるので、自分好みのグラフにすることができます。
グラフの表示期間は１ヶ月、２ヶ月、３ヶ月、半年と調整することができます。
また体温だけでなく、体重や体脂肪のグラフも見ることができますよ。


■グラフの出力・印刷
グラフ画面のボタンから、グラフを画像化して出力し、その画像を保存・印刷することができます。
パソコンへ送ってもよいですし、印刷をすることもできます。
コンビニに行けば端末の画像を印刷できるサービスもありますので、それを利用して、簡単にグラフをA4用紙に印刷することができます。
これをそのまま産婦人科へ持っていくこともできますし、指定の用紙に記入する際も分かりやすく記入できます。


■データバックアップ
登録していったデータはExcelのCSVファイルへ出力できます。
そしてiPhoneを機種変更したとき等はそのデータを読み込ませることで、スムーズに機種変更したあとも本アプリをお使いいただけます。
長く使うアプリだから、iPhoneを変えなきゃいけなくなったときのことも考える必要がありますが、これなら安心です。
他のアプリではこの機能が有料課金だったりしますが、シンプル基礎体温はこれら全ての機能が無料なので安心です。


■リマインダー
入力忘れ防止のために、リマインダーの通知機能を使うことができます。
通常時はオフになっていますので、忘れがちな人は設定してみましょう。


■生理・排卵の期間予想
生理期間や生理日数の設定をすることで、生理・排卵予想をアプリが行います。
何度か生理の日数・期間を記録し、アプリの設定から生理期間や生理日数を登録し直しましょう。
アプリは登録された生理期間や生理日数から、生理予想日と排卵予想日を算出します。
ただし、排卵予想日はオギノ式を採用しておりますが、あくまで目安として参考程度までとし、ご自身でつけている基礎体温の変化を判断材料として重視しましょう。

本アプリは、あくまで目安としての生理予想期間と排卵予想期間を表示しており、実際の日にちは、お使いになる方の体調の変化によって、しばしば変わることがあるものです。
あまり予想期間が当たらないという方は、設定画面の「グラフ設定」や「カレンダー設定」から「生理予想期間を表示する」と「排卵予想期間を表示する」をオフにしてください。

It is an app they can use the entire 9 months of their pregnancy as well as take into the delivery room, to help them be calm and centered. Positive affirmations and breathing techniques keep the mom, more focused during her labor. Hypno-Birthing teaches women to trust in the natural way of birth that women have done for thousands of years. It teaches them to relax and trust, that their body and baby know just what to do.

 

By practicing a few key techniques such as, visual imagery, breathing and relaxation exercises, mothers program their minds and condition their bodies to birth easily. It allows women to use their natural instincts to bring about a safer, easier, more comfortable birthing without drugs. Hypno-Birthing gives women the opportunity to prepare for childbirth naturally and teaches them how to stay calm so that they are not interfering with their birthing process by having anxiety and fear. When they are not afraid they are able to focus on their body and let it do what it's made to do, after all, it knew how to make the baby why wouldn't it know how to birth it?

The early years of your child’s life are VERY important. You do all you can to love and care for them and ensure they are kept safe. Yet, what if the foods they are exposed to have the potential to cause them harm, even before they are born? For expecting mums or those preparing for pregnancy, this app is an ESSENTIAL tool to reduce risks. A KEY FEATURE is the list of food chemicals that are known or suspected teratogens.  Teratogenic food additives are those that may cause reproductive failure, birth defects, growth and mental development retardation, foetal damage and/or death. Often the effects of abnormal embryo development are present at birth, yet they also may not be diagnosed until later in life. It is, therefore, important to become aware of the potential dangers of these food additives and avoid them wherever possible.

Become a “food detective” and take control of what you and your family eat!

* You want a baby, but this desire has remained unfulfilled so far?
* You have can gone through many examinations, but biologically there is no reason that you haven't become pregnant?
* You want to finally let go of your fears, doubts and tormenting thoughts that you are """"barren""""?

Heike and Christian are just as in love as the first day, and got married three years ago. To make their family's happiness perfect, both want nothing more than to have a baby. But Heike simply continues not to get pregnant. In the past two years the two have tried many things, but their desire to have children so far remains unfulfilled. The couple has undergone many examinations, but biologically everything is in order.

The causes of an unfulfilled desire to have children can be varied – hormonal disorders, organic diseases, the woman's age, decreased sperm quality, etc. However, often no medical reasons can be discerned. Stress, anxiety, other mental causes, or the circular thought process that one is """"barren"""", can cause internal blockages that also prevent pregnancy.

HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS

""""Get Pregnant! Getting Pregnant by Hypnosis” is an additional program within the range of medical hypnosis, and is aimed at biologically healthy women with fertility problems. This audio program is designed to help affected women to abandon fears and doubts about their own fertility. With special hypnosis techniques Kim Fleckenstein leads the listener into deep physical and mental relaxation. In this way inner blockages are released, and letting go of the debilitating thought """"not able to get pregnant"""" is encouraged.

We know the feeling, the excitement, the expectations, we have been there ourselves.

We also came up with the great idea of using our iPhone to track the contractions. Nothing wrong with pen and paper but when it comes to calculating it is hard to beat a machine.

We found several apps with the ability to time contractions but not the app that we wanted. There were three things that made us start thinking:

First, the user interface. In a tense situation you should not have to think about how things work and how to navigate.

Second, we wanted to show the contractions visually. A diagram works better than numbers.

Third, we wanted to avoid unnecessary features. A contraction app should focus on what is most important, giving you an uncluttered view of your contractions. 

Consequently, we have tried to pinpoint the most important features:

* Track your contractions. Contractions are saved with information about duration, frequency and start time. 
* Real-time graph that illustrates and clarifies your contractions during 10, 30 and 60 minutes. 
* History of your contractions.
* E-mail your contraction history. Great to be able to save the information outside the app.

While there is a number of different advices about when time is right to go to the hospital we have deliberately not built in support for any specific advice. Regardless of which advice you have received you are able to track important information about your contractions with 'The Contraction App'. 

We would love to get feedback on the app to be able to make it even better. Please leave a review or visit our support site.

We hope you will enjoy 'The Contraction App' and find it useful.

Good Luck!

Having a positive psychological mindset will help you to have the best possible birthing experience. 

Following on from Joyful Pregnancy, Blissful Birth is a superb high quality audio, featuring recordings by million selling audio hypnotherapist Glenn Harrold and Janey Lee Grace, co-presenter of the BBC Steve Wright Radio 2 show. Janey is also a mother of 4 young children, author of Imperfectly Natural Baby and Toddler and the Patron of the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers. 

Janey Lee Grace has created two inspirational audio tracks, the first track will help you prepare for giving birth and the second track will help you after giving birth. On track one Janey offers encouragement and advice (taken from her own personal experience of four natural births) for the last few weeks of pregnancy and explains how to prepare your mind and body for the birth you desire. Track two is to be used post-natally to help through those first few days and weeks. Janey gives you many tips and ideas on how to nurture yourself and your newborn baby naturally.

To compliment Janey’s recordings Glenn has also created two relaxing hypnotherapy tracks to help you before and after giving birth. Both tracks are high quality recordings combining clinical hypnotherapy techniques with state of the art digital recording technology. On both tracks you will be guided into a wonderful state of mental and physical relaxation. Track one will help you prepare for the final stages of your pregnancy and giving birth and track two will help you after giving birth. 

Like all of Glenn’s recordings these tracks feature special background sound effects have been recorded in certain keys and frequencies to help enhance the relaxation effect. At the deepest point in the session you are given a number of empowering post-hypnotic affirmations and direct suggestions to help you have the best possible birth experience. 

Much of the pain of labour can be eased by using the techniques on these recordings. Many studies show that positive feelings can have a profound impact on babies in the womb. Bruce H. Lipton, PhD, an internationally best-selling author and stem cell biologist says that, “positive thoughts may be the ultimate health tip for a pregnant woman”. 

Give your baby the very best start in life. This wonderful app is full of advice and powerful hypnotic suggestions to help you through the birthing and post natal experience.

Always know what your mare is up to!

During a mare’s pregnancy it is vital for the owners or staff to be present when their mare is going into labour in order to provide assistance and medical help when required. Doing so greatly reduces the risk of harm to your mare and her foal.  

Foal App utilises a smartphone attached to the halter on your pregnant mare, an alarm with a video call will sound on your smartphone if she lays down, warning you of a possible imminent foaling.

The video and audio feed helps you to determine false alarms, avoiding numerous late night treks to the barn or paddock. You can also make an on demand video call to check on your mare at anytime.

Can also be used for monitoring ill horses (for surveillance and alarm when the horse lays down).

BENEFITS

Simple to setup and use.
Phone is easily and safely attached to your mare’s halter using the specially designed Foal App pouch
Reliable in any weather
Long range (via Wi-Fi or mobile network)
Alarm includes a live video stream
Alarm directly to your mobile phone
Alarm can alert multiple mobile phones if required
Includes on-demand live video streaming
Torch on the sensor phone is controlled on your phone
Low battery and lost connection alerts

Please Note!
FoalApp is free to download, however, you will need to purchase at least one week of monitoring time to be able to monitor a Mare.
You will also need to purchase a pouch from www.foalapp.com/shop to attach a device to a Mare and monitor it.","iPhone5-iPhone5,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

“iHydrate is great! As a dancer I need to keep hydrated so I don't injure myself. I used to forget about drinking water. Now that I have iHydrate it tells me approximately how much water I need to drink for the day. Now I'm now more conscientious about that amount of water I consume. It's so easy to use. I love the pie chart feature; which shows me my amount of water intake I've had for the day. I appreciate the different drink options, because I like having a variety of juices! It's a great app, I use it so much!”

“I’ve been looking for one of these for a while. And it's so useful that it's on my home screen. I have a very busy schedule and forget to drink water a lot. I've even gone a whole day without drinking before. That being said since downloading iHydrate, I have met my goal every day. I especially like how I can calculate for all sorts of drinks, and I've noticed it calculates a percentage of non-water drinks. That's really helpful in helping me see how hydrated I am, when I'm not just drinking water.”

Ever growing, Mother, Baby & Child is yet another addition focusing to a rather different niche: parenting and children.
Darine Williams is the founder of Mother, Baby & Child magazine. In a matter of months, this ‘brainchild’ of hers has grown eyes to see the world, hands and feet to explore and wings to spread the joys of motherhood.
Mother, Baby & Child magazine focuses on Pre-Conception, Pregnancy, New Family, Birth, Toddler, Infant and Motherhood. It aspires to offer women useful and original pieces that they cannot find anywhere else. Mothers are given their much deserved attention with fashion, inspirational, health & wellbeing segments among others. The magazine encourages readers by featuring mother entrepreneurs, charity workers and women environmentalists. It also makes motherhood fun with its interactive competition and voucher pages both in the magazine and social media.
Eventually, Mother, Baby & Child will go to the next level – published in Arabic and to be distributed across the GCC.

It might seem strange that you need to learn specific breathing techniques when breathing is such a natural, every day thing that we do without thinking, but there is no other time when you will experience such intense physical and deep emotional changes than when you are giving birth. So you definitely want to be aware of your breath and have some well practiced techniques that you can turn to when you feel like you are losing control. 

The 5 breathing exercises included in this app will help you to take notice of how you breathe naturally and how to learn powerful techniques that will be your biggest lifeline during labor and birth.

Each of these breathing techniques is important in its own way and should be practiced with awareness during pregnancy. They all work together, and although I encourage you to go through them individually and become comfortable with each one before moving on, you will soon move through them all seamlessly together. The more you practice them the more natural and instinctive they will become, and the easier it will be to use them effectively when you most need them. 

What you are working towards is a deep awareness of the power of your breath to guide and transform your experience. You know that labor and birth will be a physically challenging event. By practising these techniques daily in different situation and with expanded awareness, you will instinctively move into these breathing patterns when you need them, with gentle guidance from your partner.

I encourage you to start by setting the timer to just 2 minutes and breathing along with the app. Notice how your mind wanders off - even during the 2 minutes. Practice bringing your mind BACK to the awareness of your breathing, your body and your baby. 

It will take practice, but WATCHING the animation and LISTENING to the sound will help to keep you FOCUSED. Set an intention to do it every day with mindful attention. You can also practice yoga, using the same pace of breathing and timing your movements to your breath. 

Enjoy this practice and please visit my online platform packed with even more juicy information.

WeightAtBirth uses two distinct methods to predict your baby's weight at birth. The app's prediction methods are based on published scientific/medical research - references included in the app. The first method, uses simple maternal height and weight measurements during pregnancy, and allows to predict the baby's weight at birth, any time after pregnancy week 37. The second method combines simple measurements with ultrasound measurements of the fetal weight and allows to obtain predictions starting with pregnancy week 28.

Besides the prediction of the baby's birth weight the app issues the estimated percentile for the baby's birth weight. Weight percentiles give you an indication of how does your baby's birth weight compare with other birth weights for similar maternal, and pregnancy conditions. 

DISCLAIMER: Regardless of the information you obtain from this app, you are urged to seek OBGYN advice during your whole pregnancy.

 *  Use the vibration action to attract the attention of a child in the womb. This technique is used by midwifes to wake a sleeping baby in the tummy if needed.

Go the F**k to Sleep is a bedtime book for parents who live in the real world, where a few snoozing kitties and cutesy rhymes don’t always send a toddler sailing blissfully off to dreamland. Profane, affectionate, and radically honest, it captures the familiar ― and unspoken ― tribulations of putting your little angel down for the night. Beautiful, subversive, and pants-wettingly funny, Go the F**k to Sleep is a book for parents new, old, and expectant. You probably should not play this for your children. 

“A children’s book for grown-ups! I really did laugh out loud―hilarious!” –David Byrne, musician, father of one “Finally, someone tells it like it really is. 

This is no-guilt funny and a godsend!” –Cristina García, author of The Lady Matador’s Hotel, mother of one “This is the most honest children’s book ever written. 

F**king hilarious.” –A.J. Jacobs, author of The Year of Living Biblically, father of three 

“Go the F**k to Sleep is the secret anthem of tired parents everywhere.” –Bliss Broyard, author of One Drop: My Father’s Hidden Life, mother of two “Captures the beautiful struggle of being a parent at its rawest point: bedtime.” –Daniel Sinker","iPhone3GS-iPhone-3GS,iPhone4-iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen-iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

Exercise during pregnancy is important, because it's the perfect path to faster postpartum weight loss and recovery. On this Application you'll find easy pregnancy exercises and fitness plans to get you moving (even when it's the last thing your swollen feet want to do). The more active and fit you are during pregnancy, the easier it will be for you to adapt to your changing shape and weight gain. It will also help you to cope with labour and get back into shape after the birth.

Pregnancy exercise is so beneficial that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies exercise at moderate intensity for at least 30 minutes a day on most or all days of the week. The ideal workout gets your heart pumping, keeps you limber, controls weight gain, and strengthens your muscles without causing undue physical stress for you or the baby. If you have not been exercising regularly prior to being pregnant, make sure you begin slowly when starting a program. If you already participate in a workout program, talk to your doctor about the program to make sure it is safe to follow during your pregnancy.

A big benefit to exercising during pregnancy is that it will help you control weight gain. You will gain less weight while you are pregnant and lose the weight more rapidly after you have the baby. Most women who exercise during pregnancy will return to their pre-pregnancy weight in less time than a woman who did no exercises at all. The best types of pregnancy exercises are walking and swimming. This is because these two activities work your major muscle groups, strengthen your heart, and pose little risk of injury. It is important that you do not over exert yourself during pregnancy. Your fitness level before you became pregnant will dictate how strenuously you can exercise while you are pregnant.

Finally, one of the benefits of pregnancy exercise is that it will strengthen your back. Back pain is a common ailment among pregnant women. The pain tends to increase gradually as your pregnancy progresses. By strengthening your back through pregnancy Workouts, you will be less likely to suffer from intense back pain. Also, keeping your weight gain manageable by exercising during your pregnancy will help limit the amount of back pain you experience.

Starting any pregnancy Workouts program requires that you consult with your doctor. Make sure that you are physically able to start and maintain an exercise program before beginning. You will undoubtedly find that you have to alter your pregnancy exercise routine as your pregnancy progresses. It is imperative that you pay close attention to any pains or discomfort you feel while exercising and seek medical help if you are at all concerned about the way that you feel during or just after exercising.

The Health Pregnancy Exercise & Relaxation Instruction provided by this application are usually safe for expectant moms, although some may not work for you during the last few months or weeks of your pregnancy. Always consult your healthcare provider before beginning any new exercise regimen. If you get the go-ahead to workout, listen to your body and be careful not to overdo it – stop if anything hurts or feels uncomfortable.","iPhone3GS-iPhone-3GS,iPhone4-iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen-iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

The First Years’ Baby Boot Camp game takes some of your typical parenting activities – feeding, soothing, potty training and cleaning – and lets you have a little fun with them. You’ll cycle through 4 short games that will have you swiping, tilting and tapping to make sure the babies are happy. 

Hungry Baby: When it’s feeding time, you will need to drag the double-sided spoon into the baby’s mouth and release it when the mouth is open. Don’t miss or you’ll have a messy and hungry baby in your hands!

Potty Drop: For potty time, tilt your device to guide the little one safely onto the Hero in Training potty. This potty training may look easy at first but keep playing to perfect your skills. 

Catch This: Once playtime begins, try to keep the floor clean by catching all the toys and sippy cups flying out of the play pen. 

Sweet Silence: The final game requires you to calm an assembly line of unhappy babies by giving each baby a GumDrop® pacifier that is the same color as their outfit. 

You can try and beat your high score or challenge your friends on Facebook. 

As you continue to play, the game will get more challenging, but that’s just part of being a parent!

A birth plan is a document that tells your health-care provider and the hospital staff:
•	What kind of childbirth you would like.
•	How you would like your baby cared for after he is born.

You can use this app to write your birth plan.
How to write a birth plan
Simple and short is best. It should be less than one page long. Try to be realistic and be aware that your childbirth will include your health-care team, yourself, your partner, the baby, and your family. 
Your birth plan works best if you write down what you want and what you would prefer if things do not happen as you planned. For example, you may write, “I would prefer not to have an intravenous needle during labour. But if the staff think I need one for a clear medical reason, then I would agree to have one, but only if, and when, it is needed.”
When to write a birth plan
Most women write a birth plan after they talk over their childbirth plans with a health-care provider and once they know what their hospital offers in terms of routines and care. It’s also a good idea to discuss the plan with your partner and your family if they are going to be involved in some way. 
However, it is your body, and your family needs to understand that you are the only one who can make some of the more personal decisions (pain control, for example).

Common things in a birth plan 
We have listed some of the common things women include in their birth plans. You do not have to include all of them in your own birth plan. If something is not as important to you, you can leave it out. If you think of something else that is not on this list, feel free to include it.

No Confusion!
A written birth plan also helps refresh your provider's memory when you're in labor. And it informs new members of your medical team — such as your labor-and-delivery nurse — about your preferences when you're in active labor.

When you're trying to get pregnant do you consider the second female - Lunar cycle? Or you focus only on your day of Ovulation? If the Ovulation day falls upon the Lunar day, the probability of conception rises to 98%.

Our ""INFERTILITY - law or case"" App is a real and proven tool for guaranteeing the calculation of two female and one male cycles. It's possible today. Just a little effort and you can convince the heavens today. This application will help you with this.
The app will calculate all three cycles for you and you will also get very useful recommendations.

This is unparalleled in the world, the application for the iPhone and iPad is developed by a doctor, the author of several patents.

The application allows to:
1. Create an individual calendar for spouses, determining the days of the highest fertility potential for both women and men. The method increases the likelihood of a positive result to 98% (as opposed to the normal 20%, focusing exclusively on the Ovulation day) and helps to solve, among the other issues, the problem of ""unclear genesis"" when a completely healthy spouses for some reason can't conceive a healthy baby for many years.

2. Calculate the individual days suitable for the conception of a child of a particular sex (makes it possible to plan the future of a family). Additionally, with this App you will get a set of special guidelines for the sexual intercourse techniques, which greatly increase the likelihood of the App predictions.

3. Accurately calculate the ""safe days"" for a woman when a conception is simply not possible at all. This is essential for all girls and women of childbearing age in order to lower the abortion rates.

This application is easy and convenient to use. You can contact the App Developer at any time on any issues related to its work.

By using the ""INFERTILITY - law or case"" App you will be able to protect and preserve your health and obtain an affective planning method for your family's future.","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

***Why download Music for Pregnancy?***

Classical music when played moderately has a calming effect rendering the heart to beat slower as well as the breathing to be deeper. This is because the music compels the brain to release endorphin which naturally relaxes the body.Thus, stress is reduced and mood is improved which are great for a baby’swell-being as well as for the caring parent. 

Babies start to hear at 6 months in the womb that is why mothers are encouraged to listen to classical music if at least just for its lasing effect for both baby and parent. Pregnancy is a special time but is riddled with stress and aiming for a calm disposition will likewise calm the baby inside. And because babies are likely to recognize the same music you played while he was still in the womb, the association will be comforting and provides baby with an extra sense of security.

Simply choose your traits and characteristics of your partner. 
Traits calculators are based on the principle of inheritance but please keep in mind that nothing is 100% certain in genetics. 

Inheritance rules still leave a lot of secrets and are under research by many scientists. Often a child may surprise their abilities and appearance because it inherits traits from the distant ancestors whose characteristics do not necessarily correspond with characteristics of parents. 

You must remember to take the results with a grain of salt. There is no app that can claim 100% accuracy when making predictions based on genetics.

There are four well known phases: the New Moon, the First Quarter, the Full Moon and the Last Quarter — and many people were born close to these phases. However, in general the phase of the Moon is simply an angle between the positions of the Sun and the Moon from the terrestrial observer's point of view. 

Our personal phase of the Moon can be very important for everyone. Most thoroughly it was studied in relation to women's ability to conceive. Dr. Eugen Jonas of Slovakia has discovered that when a woman has her Phase Day, the probability of conceiving a child increases greatly, even if that moment falls at a period in her hormonal cycle that is considered to be unsuitable for conception, such as menstruation. You can read more about Dr. Jonas and his research in this article: https://www.lunarium.co.uk/articles/jonas.jsp

It was noticed that men's sperm count increases very significantly on their Phase Day, and so their ability to conceive a child increases too.

But Phase Day's significance goes far beyond childbirth. It was noticed long ago that sportsmen and athletes show their best results when competition or game falls on their Phase Day. This fact was used, and maybe is still used, by thoughtful trainers and coaches. 

So if you are a fan of some team, find out when the key players were born and then define their Phase Days. This is when they will perform the best, this is when the team will have more chances to win a game.

It looks like on one's personal Phase Day, his or her body is somehow powerfully in tune with the Nature, and this is why people are able to do things that would be impossible on some other day. So why don't you use this program to calculate *your* personal Phase Days?","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

It shows postures that help keep you active during your pregnancy.  It includes breathing techniques to help you relax while you're pregnant and for when you are on your special journey to meet your baby. Using this App means you are taking time for you and time to connect to your baby through your pregnancy. 

Practising yoga during pregnancy can be highly beneficial for you and your baby. Yoga helps build strength and encourages relaxation.  The postures help you adapt to the changes in your body that occur during pregnancy and the breathing and relaxation techniques enable you to relax more easily.

The exercises are shown in short sequences and the instructions and demonstrations are easy to follow. The chapters mention adaptations for ladies who suffer from pelvic girdle pain, heartburn and carpel tunnel syndrome where appropriate.

It features two relaxations often useful after a long day at work:

A short one, which encourages making time to connect to baby.

A longer one, which is a complete relaxation using the visualisation of floating on a cloud.  Imagining you are floating on a cloud is a wonderful way to you to keep you calm and relaxed.

THE SEQUENCES:
Warm up:  
Not only warms the joints and muscles, but can release energy blocks in the body, thereby giving you more energy.

Cat posture:  
This is a fabulous posture to help keep your spine supple as well easing those backaches some of you experience.  Practising Cat Posture also gives baby the opportunity to be in the correct position for birth and this posture can actually be used to give birth.

Standing Sequence:  
Shows a circular movement to help keep your hips fluid. Incorporates squatting which help strengthen legs and a gentle twist.

Flowing Sequence:  
Is a series of postures, flowing from one to the other. 

Warrior: 
An empowering posture for strength.

Pregnancy Pelvic Floor:
The pelvic floor is an important part of anyone’s anatomy.  However pregnancy places extra weight on the pelvic floor,

This chapter not only explains how to practise the exercises, but also gives an unorthodox visual aid to encourage you to do so.

Anna White is a qualified British Wheel of yoga teacher who specialises in pregnancy yoga, which she has been teaching for over six years.  She teaches five classes each week and many ladies attend her classes.  Quite a number of them are now going for their second pregnancy and some are on their third. Lots of them have commented how much they have enjoyed the classes and how useful the breathing techniques have been when they are on their journey to meet their baby, keeping them calm, relaxed and focused during their contractions.

It was the ladies from the classes who suggested to her to produce a DVD and from that this App.","iPhone3GS-iPhone-3GS,iPadWifi-iPadWifi,iPad3G-iPad3G,iPodTouchThirdGen-iPodTouchThirdGen,iPhone4-iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen-iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

Listening to the audio tracks regularly throughout your pregnancy and birth, can help you feel more:
- confident
- focused
- relaxed
- in control
- connected to God 
- connected to your baby
- and spiritually empowered

App features:
- Listen: Seven Christian Hypnobirthing tracks which can be streamed through the app (this requires an internet connection)
- Download Tracks: A link to be able to download the tracks and load them into your own listening device (so you can listen without internet)
- Positive Birth: A section with links to inspiring birth videos, information about breastfeeding, ideas for your hospital bag and more

The first section ‘Listen’ is made up of seven audio tracks that include: prayers for strength, encouraging scriptures for birthing, breathing and visualisation exercises to help you relax, positive affirmations to keep your thoughts focused and confident, and relaxation music to underscore your own prayers or meditation. If you are planning on having your baby in a hospital or midwife led unit with no internet, we also provide a link (within the app) to download the tracks onto your computer, and load them into your own listening device. 

We recommend listening to Christian Hypnobirthing at least two to three times a week from 30 weeks, and as often as every day from 36 weeks. Don’t worry if you are further along, however, as there are benefits regardless of how many times you listen to it. 

One of the main causes of pain during childbirth is fear. Fear causes your body to release hormones that block endorphins, which are your body’s natural pain relievers. Fear can also cause your muscles to tense up, making the opening of the body in labour harder and therefore more painful. Being in a state of faith, love and strength can help you to overcome fear and as a result, birth can be a more satisfying, joyful and empowered experience. Listening to Christian Hypnobirthing can help you to come into this faith filled state, but also being well informed about the different stages of labour and early parenthood, can help you feel more prepared, confident and relaxed about the birthing process. For this reason, in the 'Positive Birth' section, we share videos, blog posts, and more, that you may find encouraging and informative. 

Combining relaxation techniques used in Hypnobirthing, with the huge power, strength and support that comes from our Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus and Holy Spirit, Christian Hypnobirthing aims to help you open to a more wonderful and spiritually empowered birth experience. 

DISCLAIMER: Christian Hypnobirthing is designed to help support you in a more comfortable birth, however it is not a substitute for the advice or presence of a qualified medical practitioner, midwife or obstetrician. It does not represent an alternative to appropriate medical care or professional medical advice, in any way shape or form, so please consult your doctor or medical caregiver before using it.

This could be a valuable present to 1st time pregnant couples for a better pregnancy care. iFetal provides more than 55 different calculations including normal fetal measurements, standard dates for screening tests, pregnancy tips plus weekly changes with pictures and audible heartbeats. You can email, save and track the results, or, share your comments directly from the app to FaceBook and Twitter.

Here are some of the information iFetal can calculate for you:
the day the egg was conceived (conception date)
the due date,
the time frame for 1st antenatal appointment 
9 recommended antenatal appointments from week 6 to delivery
the earliest date that a home pregnancy test can becomes positive
the earliest date that the fetal heart will start beating
the earliest date to book for a dating ultrasound scan
the standard dates for booking a routine fetal developmental ultrasound scan
the recommended dates for booking 1st and 2nd trimester screening blood tests including combined test (nuchal translucency scan, PAPP-A and beta hCG), multiplexed maternal plasma DNA sequencing test (a new blood test that may eliminate the need for NT scan and amniocentesis), triple, quad or penta screening tests
time frame for amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (if required)
iFetal allows you to adjust the number of days in each period (not everyone has 28 day cycles) thus the most accurate calculation of due date and conception date
fetal age can be calculated by: 1) the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), 2) by conception date (CD) or IVF date, 3) by previous ultrasound scan, and 4) by due date (EDD)
reverse calculation of the LMP, CD by EDD or any other methods
correlated gestational sac diameter with the gestational age in the first trimester 
calculation of the 1st day of the 2nd and 3rd trimesters
countdown to the due date
correlation of the EGA with the normal ranges of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels in the first trimester 
correlation of the EGA with the expected size of the yolk sac diameter (YSD) in the first trimester 
correlation of the EGA with the expected size of the gestation sac diameter (GSD) in the first trimester
correlation of the EGA with the normal ranges of the estimated fetal weight (EFW)
correlation of the EGA with the normal ranges of the amniotic fluid index (AFI) 
correlation of the EGA with the normal range of fetal length (crown to rump) before 20 weeks 
correlation of the EGA with the normal range of fetal length (crown to heel) after 20 weeks 
correlation of the EGA with the normal range of fetal heart rate (FHR) for each week of pregnancy
correlation of the EGA with the expected size of fetal head, abdomen, femur length, long bones in the lower leg, humerus length, long bones in the forearm and foot length
weekly developmental changes

Learn the most widely used NATURAL METHOD of family planning in the world – The  Ovulation Method of Natural Family Planning.
This App is unique because it teaches you the Ovulation Method as you keep your daily chart in a single and easy way. You do not need any complicated calculations or temperature readings. You just need to observe the natural signs of fertility within your body and follow the daily instructions of the App. ""Your body knows""!

What’s so Special About this App?

It’s special because it has the Most Advanced Scientific Research and statistical evaluations of any Natural Family Planning Method in the world today. It has been demonstrated through worldwide studies that the Ovulation Method is 99% effective in postponing pregnancy and in a recent study, 91% effective in helping couples achieve pregnancy.
This application will allow you to LEARN and keep a CHART of your cycle in a simple and efficient way, throughout your reproductive years regardless of your level of knowledge of the Ovulation Method.

For example:

1. The Ovulation Method is used for women of normal fertility to achieve or postpone pregnancy according to what mode you choose to follow.
2. Women with irregular cycles will be given assistance throughout each day of the cycle to follow the Ovulation Method correctly. The App will help them understand the possible reasons for the irregularity of their cycles and how to correct it with good healthy nutrition and supplementary vitamins.
3. Women who want to conceive a baby will learn that her future baby is the single most important person protecting her from breast cancer. She will know the benefits of nursing her baby for her and her baby and how pregnancy and breastfeeding prevents cancer of the breast in women.
4. Women who are entering pre-menopause are equally successful in following the Ovulation Method when her cycles begin to vary at the end of her fertile life.
5. Women who are under stress will be guided to chart successfully during those difficult stages of their lives.
6. Women who are discontinuing the birth control pill, the patch, Depo-Provera injections, Implants or Intra-uterine devices can learn the Ovulation Method successfully. They  will be given instructions as to the possible effects that take place immediately after suspending any of the various artificial methods of birth control in order to follow the Ovulation Method correctly. Because artificial methods of birth control deplete women of basic nutrients, it is advisable to have a good nutritional diet and supplementary vitamins to assist the body to return to normal faster.
7. Successful in helping couples conceive Our unique study conducted to help couples who have trouble conceiving pregnancy is incredible!  Out of 54 couples who had trouble conceiving, anywhere from one to 12 years, 50 of them conceived! That is 91% success in achieving pregnancy! There was no need for medication or hormones to regulate their cycles. We accomplished  regulating their cycles through good nutrition and supplementary vitamins. So far, this is the highest success rate in the field of fertility.
8. Statistical Study Confirms Low Divorce Rate Our own study confirmed that couples who practice the Ovulation Method of Natural Family Planning have a very low divorce rate of only 3%. The reason being that with Natural Family Planning, both husband and wife accept responsibility to either bring life into the world or postpone it.  The Ovulation Method of Natural Family Planning increases communication between the spouses as they share a deeper intimacy with each other. This increases their feelings of being loved not used. This way they both preserve the family unit more responsibly and are happier and more satisfied in their every day lives. In other words, the couple discover that true love is the gift of self within their family unit.","iPhone3GS-iPhone-3GS,iPhone4-iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen-iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi,iPad23G-iPad23G,iPhone4S-iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5-iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini-iPadMini,iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G,iPhone5c-iPhone5c,iPhone5s-iPhone5s,iPadAir-iPadAir,iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular,iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina,iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular,iPhone6-iPhone6,iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus,iPadAir2-iPadAir2,iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular,iPadMini3-iPadMini3,iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular,iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen,iPhone6s-iPhone6s,iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus,iPadMini4-iPadMini4,iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular,iPadPro-iPadPro,iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular,iPadPro97-iPadPro97,iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular,iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE,iPhone7-iPhone7,iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus,iPad611-iPad611,iPad612-iPad612,iPad71-iPad71,iPad72-iPad72,iPad73-iPad73,iPad74-iPad74,iPhone8-iPhone8,iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus,iPhoneX-iPhoneX,iPad75-iPad75,iPad76-iPad76"

The App was developed by experts and ensures that you exercise correctly.  

Use the App as a motivation for making pelvic floor exercises an integral part of your daily life. It is your tool to have at hand at all times. Now, you can squeeze correctly – anytime and anywhere. 

Why are pelvic floor exercises so important?
Pregnancy and birth strain the pelvic floor muscles that can also slacken with advancing age. Pelvic floor exercises are important, in order for you to rediscover your body and be able to do all the activities you were used to doing before getting pregnant. Many women experience difficulties holding in urine after giving birth, for example while running, jumping on a trampoline or when laughing, sneezing or coughing. It is scientifically proven that pelvic floor exercises have a significant effect on incontinence, both before, during and after pregnancy. But as with any training, it’s all about getting started as soon as possible and training both properly and regularly.  

Functions:

The app has several functions that ensure successful pelvic floor training. 
- Reminders
- Photos
- Videos with exercises 
- Sound files
- ’My downloads’:Your downloaded videos and sound files, which you can also use offline.

The exercises are divided into three levels, ensuring that everyone can participate regardless of the individual level. 
1. Beginner
2. Slightly experienced
3. Very experienced

I was Breaking Dad.

This is the app that I wish I had during the pregnancy.  There were books and websites that gave good information, but I found that there were two things that I wanted help tracking on a day to day basis.

1.  What baby stuff have we acquired and what do we still need?
2.  Can my wife eat _____?

We ended up with papers, notes, online documents and other things to keep track of these two bits of information.  It became confusing. 

On top of this, I had little clue as to all the stuff that was available for newborns.  I picked this up over time, but it would have been nice to have this information in an easy-to-consume format.  

Breaking Dad helps track all of this… with a bit of an irreverent attitude.  You can’t Break Dad without adding in a few Dad Jokes! 

The free version of the app will:
1.  Explain common baby items
2.  Give a starting point for healthy foods and which to avoid.  This should be checked with the doctor. I’m a programmer, not a doctor.
3.  Dad Thoughts!  Witticisms, advice or just random thoughts.

For the cost of about 6 diapers, the in-app purchase will give you full access.  It will:
1.  Let you add or delete baby items.
2.  Track how many of the baby items you own, and how many you want.
3.  Track which food safety recommendations you’ve checked with the doctor.
4.  Let you modify existing food safety recommendations.
5.  Add or delete foods as desired.

Thanks for reading… and here’s a couple dad jokes for your time!

The dream of being pregnant came into your life and as expected, you want to take the control and get information about each change and progress in your and your baby’s body.
Like your doctor does at each control with a Pregnancy Wheel (also called gestational Disc, Obstetric Wheel, or Pregnancy Calculator), today through Gestograma of Facemamá.com, you will be able to access from your iPhone to everything you need to know about the development of your pregnancy.
With this useful application you can get, within seconds and by only rotating the wheel until your last menstrual period (LMP), details of: 
Your baby:
- BPD (Bi Parietal Diameter) or diameter of  your baby’s head
- LF (femur length), it is the longest bone in the body of your baby.
- Weight
- Size or Height
- AFP (Abdominal Fetal Perimeter) or circumference of your baby's abdomen

About you mom:
- Number of weeks of pregnancy
- Possible Birth Date of your baby
- Estimated weight gain, very useful to determine whether you are exceeded in weight
- Uterine Height, or how much your uterus has grown in pregnancy
- The max number of contractions per hour in the actual pregancy week
And as each stage of pregnancy is different, this application will allow you access to details of each week from facemama.com, guiding you with the changes in your body, the necessary care, special situations and all that can generate confusion to you.
The contents of “weeks of pregnancy“ also shows you images and videos of 3D ultrasound. (This feature requires internet connection).
This is the first version of our software and we will be updating with more information allowing you to continue enjoying your pregnancy even more.
